AB Marek's disease virus (MDV) is a highly contagious alphaherpesvirus that infects chickens and causes a deadly neoplastic disease. We previously demonstrated that MDV infection arrests cells in S phase and that the tegument protein VP22 plays a major role in this process. In addition, expression of VP22 induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the cellular DNA, suggesting that DNA damage and the associated cellular response might be favorable for the MDV life cycle. Here, we addressed the role of DNA damage in MDV replication and pathogenesis. We demonstrated that MDV induces DSBs during lytic infection in vitro and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected animals. Intriguingly, we did not observe DNA damage in latently infected MDV-induced lymphoblastoid cells, while MDV reactivation resulted in the onset of DNA lesions, suggesting that DNA damage and/or the resulting DNA damage response might be required for efficient MDV replication and reactivation. In addition, reactivation was significantly enhanced by the induction of DNA damage using a number of chemicals. Finally, we used recombinant viruses to show that VP22 is required for the induction of DNA damage in vivo and that this likely contributes to viral oncogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Marek's disease virus is an oncogenic alphaherpesvirus that causes fatal T-cell lymphomas in chickens. MDV causes substantial losses in the poultry industry and is also used in small-animal models for virus-induced tumor formation. DNA damage not only is implicated in tumor development but also aids in the life cycle of several viruses; however, its role in MDV replication, latency, and reactivation remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that MDV induces DNA lesions during lytic replication in vitro and in vivo. DNA damage was not observed in latently infected cells; however, it was reinitiated during reactivation. Reactivation was significantly enhanced by the induction of DNA damage. Recombinant viruses that lacked the ability to induce DNA damage were defective in their ability to induce tumors, suggesting that DNA damage might also contribute to cellular transformation processes leading to MDV lymphomagenesis.

TI Coat Protein Mutations That Alter the Flux of Morphogenetic

AB Two scaffolding proteins orchestrate phi X174 morphogenesis. The internal scaffolding protein B mediates the formation of pentameric assembly intermediates, whereas the external scaffolding protein D organizes 12 of these intermediates into procapsids. Aromatic amino acid side chains mediate most coat-internal scaffolding protein interactions. One residue in the internal scaffolding protein and three in the coat protein constitute the core of the B protein binding cleft. The three coat gene codons were randomized separately to ascertain the chemical requirements of the encoded amino acids and the morphogenetic consequences of mutation. The resulting mutants exhibited a wide range of recessive phenotypes, which could generally be explained within a structural context. Mutants with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine substitutions were phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type. However, tryptophan substitutions were detrimental at two sites. Charged residues were poorly tolerated, conferring extreme temperature-sensitive and lethal phenotypes. Eighteen lethal and conditional lethal mutants were genetically and biochemically characterized. The primary defect associated with the missense substitutions ranged from inefficient internal scaffolding protein B binding to faulty procapsid elongation reactions mediated by external scaffolding protein D. Elevating B protein concentrations above wild-type levels via exogenous, cloned-gene expression compensated for inefficient B protein binding, as did suppressing mutations within gene B. Similarly, elevating D protein concentrations above wildtype levels or compensatory mutations within gene D suppressed faulty elongation. Some of the parental mutations were pleiotropic, affecting multiple morphogenetic reactions. This progressively reduced the flux of intermediates through the pathway. Accordingly, multiple mechanisms, which may be unrelated, could restore viability.
   IMPORTANCE Genetic analyses have been instrumental in deciphering the temporal events of many biochemical pathways. However, pleiotropic effects can complicate analyses. Vis-a-vis virion morphogenesis, an improper protein-protein interaction within an early assembly intermediate can influence the efficiency of all subsequent reactions. Consequently, the flux of assembly intermediates cumulatively decreases as the pathway progresses. During morphogenesis, phi X174 coat protein participates in at least four well-defined reactions, each one characterized by an interaction with a scaffolding or structural protein. In this study, genetic analyses, biochemical characterizations, and physiological assays, i.e., elevating the protein levels with which the coat protein interacts, were used to elucidate pleiotropic effects that may alter the flux of intermediates through a morphogenetic pathway.

AB HIV-1-infected macrophages participate in virus dissemination and establishment of virus reservoirs in host tissues, but the mechanisms for virus cell-to-cell transfer to macrophages remain unknown. Here, we reveal the mechanisms for cell-to-cell transfer from infected T cells to macrophages and virus spreading between macrophages. We show that contacts between infected T lymphocytes and macrophages lead to cell fusion for the fast and massive transfer of CCR5-tropic viruses to macrophages. Through the merge of viral material between T cells and macrophages, these newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells acquire the ability to fuse with neighboring noninfected macrophages. Together, these two-step envelope-dependent cell fusion processes lead to the formation of highly virus-productive multinucleated giant cells reminiscent of the infected multinucleated giant macrophages detected in HIV-1-infected patients and simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques. These mechanisms represent an original mode of virus transmission for viral spreading and a new model for the formation of macrophage virus reservoirs during infection.
   IMPORTANCE We reveal a very efficient mechanism involved in cell-to-cell transfer from infected T cells to macrophages and subsequent virus spreading between macrophages by a two-step cell fusion process. Infected T cells first establish contacts and fuse with macrophage targets. The newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells then acquire the ability to fuse with surrounding uninfected macrophages, leading to the formation of infected multinucleated giant cells that can survive for a long time, as evidenced in vivo in lymphoid organs and the central nervous system. This route of infection may be a major determinant for virus dissemination and the formation of macrophage virus reservoirs in host tissues during HIV-1 infection.

AB Most preclinical animal studies test influenza vaccines in immunologically naive animal models, even though the results of vaccination may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of vaccine candidates in humans that have preexisting immunity to influenza. In this study, novel, broadly reactive influenza vaccine candidates were assessed in preimmune ferrets. These animals were infected with different H1N1 isolates before being vaccinated or infected with another influenza virus. Previously, our group has described the design and characterization of computationally optimized broadly reactive hemagglutinin (HA) antigens (COBRA) for H1N1 isolates. Vaccinating ferrets with virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines expressing COBRA HA proteins elicited antibodies with hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity against more H1N1 viruses in the panel than VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Specifically, ferrets infected with the 1986 virus and vaccinated with a single dose of the COBRA HA VLP vaccines elicited antibodies with HAI activity against 11 to 14 of the 15 H1N1 viruses isolated between 1934 and 2013. A subset of ferrets was infected with influenza viruses expressing the COBRA HA antigens. These COBRA preimmune ferrets had superior breadth of HAI activity after vaccination with COBRA HA VLP vaccines than COBRA preimmune ferrets vaccinated with VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins. Overall, priming naive ferrets with COBRA HA based viruses or using COBRA HA based vaccines to boost preexisting antibodies induced by wild-type H1N1 viruses, COBRA HA antigens elicited sera with the broadest HAI reactivity against multiple antigenic H1N1 viral variants. This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of a broadly reactive or universal influenza vaccine in a preimmune ferret model.
   IMPORTANCE Currently, many groups are testing influenza vaccine candidates to meet the challenge of developing a vaccine that elicits broadly reactive and long-lasting protective immune responses. The goal of these vaccines is to stimulate immune responses that react against most, if not all, circulating influenza strains, over a long period of time in all populations of people. Commonly, these experimental vaccines are tested in naive animal models that do not have anti-influenza immune responses; however, humans have preexisting immunity to influenza viral antigens, particularly antibodies to the HA and NA glycoproteins. Therefore, this study investigated how preexisting antibodies to historical influenza viruses influenced HAI-specific antibodies and protective efficacy using a broadly protective vaccine candidate.

AB Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) causes significant upper and lower respiratory disease in all age groups worldwide. The virus possesses a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 13.3 kb encapsidated by multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (N), giving rise to helical nucleocapsids. In addition, copies of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large RNA polymerase (L) decorate the viral nucleocapsids. After viral attachment, endocytosis, and fusion mediated by the viral glycoproteins, HMPV nucleocapsids are released into the cell cytoplasm. To visualize the subsequent steps of genome transcription and replication, a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol was established to detect different viral RNA subpopulations in infected cells. The FISH probes were specific for detection of HMPV positive-sense RNA (+RNA) and viral genomic RNA (vRNA). Time course analysis of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells infected with HMPV revealed the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) from early times postinfection. HMPV IBs were shown to be cytoplasmic sites of active transcription and replication, with the translation of viral proteins being closely associated. Inclusion body formation was consistent with an actin-dependent coalescence of multiple early replicative sites. Time course quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis suggested that the coalescence of inclusion bodies is a strategy to efficiently replicate and transcribe the viral genome. These results provide a better understanding of the steps following HMPV entry and have important clinical implications.
   IMPORTANCE Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently discovered pathogen that affects human populations of all ages worldwide. Reinfections are common throughout life, but no vaccines or antiviral treatments are currently available. In this work, a spatiotemporal analysis of HMPV replication and transcription in bronchial epithelial cell-derived immortal cells was performed. HMPV was shown to induce the formation of large cytoplasmic granules, named inclusion bodies, for genome replication and transcription. Unlike other cytoplasmic structures, such as stress granules and processing bodies, inclusion bodies are exclusively present in infected cells and contain HMPV RNA and proteins to more efficiently transcribe and replicate the viral genome. Though inclusion body formation is nuanced, it corresponds to a more generalized strategy used by different viruses, including filoviruses and rhabdoviruses, for genome transcription and replication. Thus, an understanding of inclusion body formation is crucial for the discovery of innovative therapeutic targets.

AB Human adenoviruses (Ad) are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses associated with infectious diseases, but they are better known as tools for gene delivery and oncolytic anticancer therapy. Atomic structures of Ad provide the basis for the development of antivirals and for engineering efforts toward more effective applications. Since 2010, atomic models of human Ad5 have been derived independently from photographic film cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography studies, but discrepancies exist concerning the assignment of cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX. To clarify these discrepancies, we employed the technology of direct electron counting to obtain a cryo-EM structure of human Ad5 at 3.2-angstrom resolution. Our improved structure unambiguously confirms our previous cryo-EM models of proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX and explains the likely cause of conflict in the crystallography models. The improved structure also allows the identification of three new components in the cavity of hexon-the cleaved N terminus of precursor protein VI (pVIn), the cleaved N terminus of precursor protein VII (pVIIn2), and mature protein VI. The binding of pVIIn2-and, by extension, that of genome-condensing pVII-to hexons is consistent with the previously proposed dsDNA genome-capsid coassembly for adenoviruses, which resembles that of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses but differs from the well-established mechanism of pumping dsDNA into a preformed protein capsid exemplified by tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses.
   IMPORTANCE Adenovirus is a double-edged sword to humans: it is a widespread pathogen but can be used as a bioengineering tool for anticancer and gene therapies. The atomic structure of the virus provides the basis for antiviral and application developments, but conflicting atomic models for the important cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX from conventional/film cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography studies have caused confusion. Using cutting-edge cryo-EM technology with electron counting, we improved the structure of human adenovirus type 5 and confirmed our previous models of cement proteins IIIa, VIII, and IX, thus clarifying the inconsistent structures. The improved structure also reveals atomic details of membrane-lytic protein VI and genome-condensing protein VII and supports the previously proposed genome-capsid coassembly mechanism for adenoviruses.

TI Human Parvovirus Infection of Human Airway Epithelia Induces Pyroptotic
   Cell Death by Inhibiting Apoptosis

AB Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a human parvovirus that causes acute respiratory tract infections in young children. In this study, we confirmed that, when polarized/well-differentiated human airway epithelia are infected with HBoV1 in vitro, they develop damage characterized by barrier function disruption and cell hypotrophy. Cell death mechanism analyses indicated that the infection induced pyroptotic cell death characterized by caspase-1 activation. Unlike infections with other parvoviruses, HBoV1 infection did not activate the apoptotic or necroptotic cell death pathway. When the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 inflammasome-induced pathway was inhibited by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), HBoV1-induced cell death dropped significantly; thus, NLRP3 mediated by ASC appears to be the pattern recognition receptor driving HBoV1 infection-induced pyroptosis. HBoV1 infection induced steady increases in the expression of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-18. HBoV1 infection was also associated with the marked expression of the antiapoptotic genes BIRC5 and IFI6. When the expression of BIRC5 and/or IFI6 was inhibited by shRNA, the infected cells underwent apoptosis rather than pyroptosis, as indicated by increased cleaved caspase-3 levels and the absence of caspase-1. BIRC5 and/or IFI6 gene inhibition also significantly reduced HBoV1 replication. Thus, HBoV1 infection of human airway epithelial cells activates antiapoptotic proteins that suppress apoptosis and promote pyroptosis. This response may have evolved to confer a replicative advantage, thus allowing HBoV1 to establish a persistent airway epithelial infection. This is the first report of pyroptosis in airway epithelia infected by a respiratory virus.
   IMPORTANCE Microbial infection of immune cells often induces pyroptosis, which is mediated by a cytosolic protein complex called the inflammasome that senses microbial pathogens and then activates the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18. While virus-infected airway epithelia often activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, studies to date suggest that these viruses kill the airway epithelial cells via the apoptotic or necrotic pathway; involvement of the pyroptosis pathway has not been reported previously. Here, we show for the first time that virus infection of human airway epithelia can also induce pyroptosis. Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), a human parvovirus, causes lower respiratory tract infections in young children. This study indicates that HBoV1 kills airway epithelial cells by activating genes that suppress apoptosis and thereby promote pyroptosis. This strategy appears to promote HBoV1 replication and may have evolved to allow HBoV1 to establish persistent infection of human airway epithelia.

TI In Vitro Approach To Identify Key Amino Acids in Low Susceptibility of

AB Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by an abnormally folded prion protein (PrPSc). This is capable of transforming the normal cellular prion protein (PrPSC) into new infectious PrPSc. Interspecies prion transmissibility studies performed by experimental challenge and the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s showed that while some species (sheep, mice, and cats) are readily susceptible to TSEs, others are apparently resistant (rabbits, dogs, and horses) to the same agent. To study the mechanisms of low susceptibility to TSEs of certain species, the mouse-rabbit transmission barrier was used as a model. To identify which specific amino acid residues determine high or low susceptibility to PrPSc propagation, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which mimics PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion with accelerated kinetics, was used. This allowed amino acid substitutions in rabbit PrP and accurate analysis of misfolding propensities. Wild-type rabbit recombinant PrP could not be misfolded into a protease-resistant self-propagating isoform in vitro despite seeding with at least 12 different infectious prions from diverse origins. Therefore, rabbit recombinant PrP mutants were designed to contain every single amino acid substitution that distinguishes rabbit recombinant PrP from mouse recombinant PrP. Key amino acid residue substitutions were identified that make rabbit recombinant PrP susceptible to misfolding, and using these, protease-resistant misfolded recombinant rabbit PrP was generated. Additional studies characterized the mechanisms by which these critical amino acid residue substitutions increased the misfolding susceptibility of rabbit PrP.
   IMPORTANCE Prion disorders are invariably fatal, untreatable diseases typically associated with long incubation periods and characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss in the brain. Development of any treatment or preventative measure is dependent upon a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, and understanding the mechanism by which certain species appear to be resistant to TSEs is critical. Rabbits are highly resistant to naturally acquired TSEs, and even under experimental conditions, induction of clinical disease is not easy. Using recombinant rabbit PrP as a model, this study describes critical molecular determinants that confer this high resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

AB Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is a circular, single-stranded, noncoding RNA plant pathogen that is a useful model for studying the processing of noncoding RNA in eukaryotes. Infective PSTVd circles are replicated via an asymmetric rolling circle mechanism to form linear multimeric RNAs. An endonuclease cleaves these into monomers, and a ligase seals these into mature circles. All eukaryotes may have such enzymes for processing noncoding RNA. As a test, we investigated the processing of three PSTVd RNA constructs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of these, only one form, a construct that adopts a previously described tetraloop-containing conformation (TL), produces circles. TL has 16 nucleotides of the 3' end duplicated at the 5' end and a 3' end produced by self-cleavage of a delta ribozyme. The other two constructs, an exact monomer flanked by ribozymes and a trihelix-forming RNA with requisite 5' and 3' duplications, do not produce circles. The TL circles contain nonnative nucleotides resulting from the 3' end created by the ribozyme and the 5' end created from an endolytic cleavage by yeast at a site distinct from where potato enzymes cut these RNAs. RNAs from all three transcripts are cleaved in places not on path for circle formation, likely representing RNA decay. We propose that these constructs fold into distinct RNA structures that interact differently with host cell RNA metabolism enzymes, resulting in various susceptibilities to degradation versus processing. We conclude that PSTVd RNA is opportunistic and may use different processing pathways in different hosts.
   IMPORTANCE In higher eukaryotes, the majority of transcribed RNAs do not encode proteins. These noncoding RNAs are responsible for mRNA regulation, control of the expression of regulatory microRNAs, sensing of changes in the environment by use of riboswitches (RNAs that change shape in response to environmental signals), catalysis, and more roles that are still being uncovered. Some of these functions may be remnants from the RNA world and, as such, would be part of the evolutionary past of all forms of modern life. Viroids are noncoding RNAs that can cause disease in plants. Since they encode no proteins, they depend on their own RNA and on host proteins for replication and pathogenicity. It is likely that viroids hijack critical host RNA pathways for processing the host's own noncoding RNA. These pathways are still unknown. Elucidating these pathways should reveal new biological functions of noncoding RNA.

AB The latency-associated nuclear antigen ( LANA) of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) performs a variety of functions to establish and maintain KSHV latency. During latency, LANA localizes to discrete punctate spots in the nucleus, where it tethers viral episomes to cellular chromatin and interacts with nuclear components to regulate cellular and viral gene expression. Using highly sensitive tyramide signal amplification, we determined that LANA localizes to the cytoplasm in different cell types undergoing the lytic cycle of replication after de novo primary infection and after spontaneous, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-, or open reading frame 50 (ORF50)/replication transactivator (RTA)-induced activation. We confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic LANA in a subset of cells in lytically active multicentric Castleman disease lesions. The induction of cellular migration by scratch-wounding confluent cell cultures, culturing under subconfluent conditions, or induction of cell differentiation in primary cultures upregulated the number of cells permissive for primary lytic KSHV infection. The induction of lytic replication was characterized by high-level expression of cytoplasmic LANA and nuclear ORF59, a marker of lytic replication. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed the presence of multiple isoforms of LANA in the cytoplasm of ORF50/RTA-activated Vero cells undergoing primary infection. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that cytoplasmic LANA isoforms were full length, containing the N-terminal nuclear localization signal. These results suggest that trafficking of LANA to different subcellular locations is a regulated phenomenon, which allows LANA to interact with cellular components in different compartments during both the latent and the replicative stages of the KSHV life cycle.
   IMPORTANCE Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes AIDS-related malignancies, including lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma. KSHV establishes lifelong infections using its latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). During latency, LANA localizes to the nucleus, where it connects viral and cellular DNA complexes and regulates gene expression, allowing the virus to maintain long-term infections. Our research shows that intact LANA traffics to the cytoplasm of cells undergoing permissive lytic infections and latently infected cells in which the virus is induced to replicate. This suggests that LANA plays important roles in the cytoplasm and nuclear compartments of the cell during different stages of the KSHV life cycle. Determining cytoplasmic function and mechanism for regulation of the nuclear localization of LANA will enhance our understanding of the biology of this virus, leading to therapeutic approaches to eliminate infection and block its pathological effects.

AB The trimeric envelope glycoprotein spike (Env) of HIV-1 is the target of vaccine development to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Env trimer instability and heterogeneity in principle make subunit interfaces inconsistent targets for the immune response. Here, we investigate how functional stability of Env relates to neutralization sensitivity to V2 bnAbs and V3 crown antibodies that engage subunit interfaces upon binding to unliganded Env. Env heterogeneity was inferred when antibodies neutralized a mutant Env with a plateau of less than 100% neutralization. A statistically significant correlation was found between the stability of mutant Envs and the MPN of V2 bnAb, PG9, as well as an inverse correlation between stability of Env and neutralization by V3 crown antibody, 447-52D. A number of Env-stabilizing mutations and V2 bnAb-enhancing mutations were identified in Env, but they did not always overlap, indicating distinct requirements of functional stabilization versus antibody recognition. Blocking complex glycosylation of Env affected V2 bnAb recognition, as previously described, but also notably increased functional stability of Env. This study shows how instability and heterogeneity affect antibody sensitivity of HIV-1 Env, which is relevant to vaccine design involving its dynamic apex.
   IMPORTANCE The Env trimer is the only viral protein on the surface of HIV-1 and is the target of neutralizing antibodies that reduce viral infectivity. Quaternary epitopes at the apex of the spike are recognized by some of the most potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies to date. Being that their glycan-protein hybrid epitopes are at subunit interfaces, the resulting heterogeneity can lead to partial neutralization. Here, we screened for mutations in Env that allowed for complete neutralization by the bnAbs. We found that when mutations outside V2 increased V2 bnAb recognition, they often also increased Env stability-of-function and decreased binding by narrowly neutralizing antibodies to the V3 crown. Three mutations together increased neutralization by V2 bnAb and eliminated binding by V3 crown antibodies. These results may aid the design of immunogens that elicit antibodies to the trimer apex.

TI Suppression of MicroRNA 424 Levels by Human Papillomaviruses Is
   Necessary for Differentiation-Dependent Genome Amplification

AB High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) link their life cycle to epithelial differentiation and require activation of DNA damage pathways for efficient replication. HPVs modulate the expression of cellular transcription factors, as well as cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) to control these activities. One miRNA that has been reported to be repressed in HPV-positive cancers of the cervix and oropharynx is miR-424. Our studies show that miR-424 levels are suppressed in cell lines that stably maintain HPV 31 or 16 episomes, as well as cervical cancer lines that contain integrated genomes such as SiHa. Introduction of expression vectors for miR-424 reduced both the levels of HPV genomes in undifferentiated cells and amplification upon differentiation. Our studies show that the levels of two putative targets of miR-424 that function in DNA damage repair, CHK1 and Wee1, are suppressed in HPV-positive cells, providing an explanation for why this microRNA is targeted in HPV-positive cells.
   IMPORTANCE We describe here for the first time a critical role for miR-424 in the regulation of HPV replication. HPV E6 and E7 proteins suppress the levels of miR424, and this is important for controlling the levels of CHK1, which plays a central role in viral replication.

TI Varicella-Zoster Virus Expresses Multiple Small Noncoding RNAs
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID MICRORNAS; GENES; NEURONS; TYPE-1; DNA
AB Many herpesviruses express small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), that may play roles in regulating lytic and latent infections. None have yet been reported in varicella-zoster virus (VZV; also known as human herpesvirus 3 [HHV-3]). Here we analyzed next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for small RNAs in VZV-infected fibroblasts and human embryonic stem cell-derived (hESC) neurons. Two independent bioinformatics analyses identified more than 20 VZV-encoded 20-to 24-nucleotide RNAs, some of which are predicted to have stemloop precursors potentially representing miRNAs. These sequences are perfectly conserved between viruses from three clades of VZV. One NGS-identified sequence common to both bioinformatics analyses mapped to the repeat regions of the VZV genome, upstream of the predicted promoter of the immediate early gene open reading frame 63 (ORF63). This miRNA candidate was detected in each of 3 independent biological repetitions of NGS of RNA from fibroblasts and neurons productively infected with VZV using TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR). Importantly, transfected synthetic RNA oligonucleotides antagonistic to the miRNA candidate significantly enhanced VZV plaque growth rates. The presence of 6 additional small noncoding RNAs was also verified by TaqMan qPCR in productively infected fibroblasts and ARPE19 cells. Our results show VZV, like other human herpesviruses, encodes several sncRNAs and miRNAs, and some may regulate infection of host cells.
   IMPORTANCE Varicella-zoster virus is an important human pathogen, with herpes zoster being a major health issue in the aging and immunocompromised populations. Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) are recognized as important actors in modulating gene expression, and this study demonstrates the first reported VZV-encoded sncRNAs. Many are clustered to a small genomic region, as seen in other human herpesviruses. At least one VZV sncRNA was expressed in productive infection of neurons and fibroblasts that is likely to reduce viral replication. Since sncRNAs have been suggested to be potential targets for antiviral therapies, identification of these molecules in VZV may provide a new direction for development of treatments for painful herpes zoster.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) establishes transcriptionally silent latent infections in resting memory T cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which allows the virus to persist in infected individuals despite antiretroviral therapy. Developing in vitro models of HIV-1 latency that recapitulate the characteristics of latently infected cells in vivo is crucial to identifying and developing effective latency-reversing therapies. HSPCs exist in a quiescent state in vivo, and quiescence is correlated with latent infections in T cells. However, current models for culturing HSPCs and for infecting T cells in vitro require that the cells be maintained in an actively proliferating state. Here we describe a novel culture system in which primary human HSPCs cultured under hypothermic conditions are maintained in a quiescent state. We show that these quiescent HSPCs are susceptible to predominantly latent infection with HIV-1, while actively proliferating and differentiating HSPCs obtain predominantly active infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the most primitive quiescent HSPCs are more resistant to spontaneous reactivation from latency than more differentiated HSPCs and that quiescent HSPCs are resistant to reactivation by histone deacetylase inhibitors or P-TEFb activation but are susceptible to reactivation by protein kinase C (PKC) agonists. We also demonstrate that inhibition of HSP90, a known regulator of HIV transcription, recapitulates the quiescence and latency phenotypes of hypothermia, suggesting that hypothermia and HSP90 inhibition may regulate these processes by similar mechanisms. In summary, these studies describe a novel model for studying HIV-1 latency in human primary cells maintained in a quiescent state.
   IMPORTANCE Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) establishes a persistent infection for which there remains no feasible cure. Current approaches are unable to clear the virus despite decades of therapy due to the existence of latent reservoirs of integrated HIV-1, which can reactivate and contribute to viral rebound following treatment interruption. Previous clinical attempts to reactivate the latent reservoirs in an individual so that they can be eliminated by the immune response or viral cytopathic effect have failed, indicating the need for a better understanding of the processes regulating HIV-1 latency. Here we characterize a novel in vitro model of HIV-1 latency in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells isolated from human cord blood that may better recapitulate the behavior of latently infected cells in vivo. This model can be used to study mechanisms regulating latency and potential therapeutic approaches to reactivate latent infections in quiescent cells.

AB African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection is characterized by a progressive decrease in cellular protein synthesis with a concomitant increase in viral protein synthesis, though the mechanism by which the virus achieves this is still unknown. Decrease of cellular mRNA is observed during ASFV infection, suggesting that inhibition of cellular proteins is due to an active mRNA degradation process. ASFV carries a gene (Ba71V D250R/Malawi g5R) that encodes a decapping protein (ASFV-DP) that has a Nudix hydrolase motif and decapping activity in vitro. Here, we show that ASFV-DP was expressed from early times and accumulated throughout the infection with a subcellular localization typical of the endoplasmic reticulum, co-localizing with the cap structure and interacting with the ribosomal protein L23a. ASFV-DP was capable of interaction with poly(A) RNA in cultured cells, primarily mediated by the N-terminal region of the protein. ASFV-DP also interacted with viral and cellular RNAs in the context of infection, and its overexpression in infected cells resulted in decreased levels of both types of transcripts. This study points to ASFV-DP as a viral decapping enzyme involved in both the degradation of cellular mRNA and the regulation of viral transcripts.
   IMPORTANCE Virulent ASFV strains cause a highly infectious and lethal disease in domestic pigs for which there is no vaccine. Since 2007, an outbreak in the Caucasus region has spread to Russia, jeopardizing the European pig population and making it essential to deepen knowledge about the virus. Here, we demonstrate that ASFV-DP is a novel RNA-binding protein implicated in the regulation of mRNA metabolism during infection, making it a good target for vaccine development.

AB Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is a common enterovirus that can cause various systemic inflammatory diseases. Because CVB lacks an envelope, it has been thought to be inherently cytolytic, wherein CVB can escape from the infected host cell only by causing it to rupture. In recent years, however, we and others have observed that various naked viruses, such as CVB, can trigger the release of infectious extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) that contain viral material. This mode of cellular escape has been suggested to allow the virus to be masked from the adaptive immune system. Additionally, we have previously reported that these viral EMVs have LC3, suggesting that they originated from autophagosomes. We now report that CVB-infected cells trigger DRP1-mediated fragmentation of mitochondria, which is a precursor to autophagic mitochondrial elimination (mitophagy). However, rather than being degraded by lysosomes, mitochondrion-containing autophagosomes are released from the cell. We believe that CVB localizes to mitochondria, induces mitophagy, and subsequently disseminates from the cell in an autophagosome-bound mitochondrion-virus complex. Suppressing the mitophagy pathway in HL-1 cardiomyocytes with either small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Mdivi-1 caused marked reduction in virus production. The findings in this study suggest that CVB subverts mitophagy machinery to support viral dissemination in released EMVs.
   IMPORTANCE Coxsackievirus B (CVB) can cause a number of life-threatening inflammatory diseases. Though CVB is well known to disseminate via cytolysis, recent reports have revealed a second pathway in which CVB can become encapsulated in host membrane components to escape the cell in an exosome-like particle. Here we report that these membrane-bound structures derive from mitophagosomes. Blocking various steps in the mitophagy pathway reduced levels of intracellular and extracellular virus. Not only does this study reveal a novel mechanism of picornaviral dissemination, but also it sheds light on new therapeutic targets to treat CVB and potentially other picornaviral infections.

TI In Vitro Neutralization Is Not Predictive of Prophylactic Efficacy of
   Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies CR6261 and CR9114 against
   Lethal H2 Influenza Virus Challenge in Mice

AB Influenza viruses of the H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes have caused previous pandemics. H2 influenza viruses represent a pandemic threat due to continued circulation in wild birds and limited immunity in the human population. In the event of a pandemic, antiviral agents are the mainstay for treatment, but broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) may be a viable alternative for short-term prophylaxis or treatment. The hemagglutinin stem binding bNAbs CR6261 and CR9114 have been shown to protect mice from severe disease following challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 and with H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses, respectively. Early studies with CR6261 and CR9114 showed weak in vitro activity against human H2 influenza viruses, but the in vivo efficacy against H2 viruses is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated these antibodies against human-and animal-origin H2 viruses A/Ann Arbor/6/1960 (H2N2) (AA60) and A/swine/MO/4296424/06 (H2N3) (Sw06). In vitro, CR6261 neutralized both H2 viruses, while CR9114 only neutralized Sw06. To evaluate prophylactic efficacy, mice were given CR6261 or CR9114 and intranasally challenged 24 h later with lethal doses of AA60 or Sw06. Both antibodies reduced mortality, weight loss, airway inflammation, and pulmonary viral load. Using engineered bNAb variants, antibody-mediated cell cytotoxicity reporter assays, and Fc gamma receptor-deficient (Fcer1g(-/-)) mice, we show that the in vivo efficacy of CR9114 against AA60 is mediated by Fc gamma receptor-dependent mechanisms. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of CR6261 and CR9114 against H2 viruses and emphasize the need for in vivo evaluation of bNAbs.
   IMPORTANCE bNAbs represent a strategy to prevent or treat infection by a wide range of influenza viruses. The evaluation of these antibodies against H2 viruses is important because H2 viruses caused a pandemic in 1957 and could cross into humans again. We demonstrate that CR6261 and CR9114 are effective against infection with H2 viruses of both human and animal origin in mice, despite the finding that CR9114 did not display in vitro neutralizing activity against the human H2 virus. These findings emphasize the importance of in vivo evaluation and testing of bNAbs.

AB Each influenza season, a set of wild-type viruses, representing one H1N1, one H3N2, and one to two influenza B isolates, are selected for inclusion in the annual seasonal influenza vaccine. In order to develop broadly reactive subtype-specific influenza vaccines, a methodology called computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) was used to design novel hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine immunogens. COBRA technology was effectively used to design HA immunogens that elicited antibodies that neutralized H5N1 and H1N1 isolates. In this report, the development and characterization of 17 prototype H3N2 COBRA HA proteins were screened in mice and ferrets for the elicitation of antibodies with HA inhibition (HAI) activity against human seasonal H3N2 viruses that were isolated over the last 48 years. The most effective COBRA HA vaccine regimens elicited antibodies with broader HAI activity against a panel of H3N2 viruses than wild-type H3 HA vaccines. The top leading COBRA HA candidates were tested against cocirculating variants. These variants were not efficiently detected by antibodies elicited by the wild-type HA from viruses selected as the vaccine candidates. The T-11 COBRA HA vaccine elicited antibodies with HAI and neutralization activity against all cocirculating variants from 2004 to 2007. This is the first report demonstrating broader breadth of vaccine-induced antibodies against cocirculating H3N2 strains compared to the wild-type HA antigens that were represented in commercial influenza vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE There is a need for an improved influenza vaccine that elicits immune responses that recognize a broader number of influenza virus strains to prevent infection and transmission. Using the COBRA approach, a set of vaccines against influenza viruses in the H3N2 subtype was tested for the ability to elicit antibodies that neutralize virus infection against not only historical vaccine strains of H3N2 but also a set of cocirculating variants that circulated between 2004 and 2007. Three of the H3N2 COBRA vaccines recognized all of the cocirculating strains during this era, but the chosen wild-type vaccine strains were not able to elicit antibodies with HAI activity against these cocirculating strains. Therefore, the COBRA vaccines have the ability to elicit protective antibodies against not only the dominant vaccine strains but also minor circulating strains that can evolve into the dominant vaccine strains in the future.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of human gammaherpesvirus, infects mainly B cells. EBV has two alternative life cycles, latent and lytic, and is reactivated occasionally from the latent stage to the lytic cycle. To combat EBV-associated disorders, understanding the molecular mechanisms of the EBV lytic replication cycle is also important. Here, we focused on an EBV lytic gene, BKRF4. Using our anti-BKRF4 antibody, we revealed that the BKRF4 gene product is expressed during the lytic cycle with late kinetics. To characterize the role of BKRF4, we constructed BKRF4-knockout mutants using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Although disruption of the BKRF4 gene had almost no effect on viral protein expression and DNA synthesis, it significantly decreased progeny virion levels in HEK293 and Akata cells. Furthermore, we show that BKRF4 is involved not only in production of progeny virions but also in increasing the infectivity of the virus particles. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that BKRF4 interacted with a virion protein, BGLF2. We showed that the C-terminal region of BKRF4 was critical for this interaction and for efficient progeny production. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that BKRF4 partially colocalized with BGLF2 in the nucleus and perinuclear region. Finally, we showed that BKRF4 is a phosphorylated, possible tegument protein and that the EBV protein kinase BGLF4 may be important for this phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggest that BKRF4 is involved in the production of infectious virions.
   IMPORTANCE Although the latent genes of EBV have been studied extensively, the lytic genes are less well characterized. This study focused on one such lytic gene, BKRF4, which is conserved only among gammaherpesviruses (ORF45 of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or murine herpesvirus 68). After preparing the BKRF4 knockout virus using B95-8 EBV-BAC, we demonstrated that the BKRF4 gene was involved in infectious progeny particle production. Importantly, we successfully generated a BKRF4 knockout virus of Akata using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, confirming the phenotype in this separate strain. We further showed that BKRF4 interacted with another virion protein, BGLF2, and demonstrated the importance of this interaction in infectious virion production. These results shed light on the elusive process of EBV progeny maturation in the lytic cycle. Notably, this study describes a successful example of the generation and characterization of an EBV construct with a disrupted lytic gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects peripheral blood monocytes and triggers biological changes that promote viral dissemination and persistence. We have shown that HCMV induces a proinflammatory state in infected monocytes, resulting in enhanced monocyte motility and transendothelial migration, prolonged monocyte survival, and differentiation toward a long-lived M1-like macrophage phenotype. Our data indicate that HCMV triggers these changes, in the absence of de novo viral gene expression and replication, through engagement and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrins on the surface of monocytes. We previously identified that HCMV induces the upregulation of multiple proinflammatory gene ontologies, with the interferon-associated gene ontology exhibiting the highest percentage of upregulated genes. However, the function of the HCMV-induced interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected monocytes remained unclear. We now show that HCMV induces the enhanced expression and activation of a key ISG transcriptional regulator, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1), via an IFN-independent but EGFR-and integrin-dependent signaling pathway. Furthermore, we identified a biphasic activation of STAT1 that likely promotes two distinct phases of STAT1-mediated transcriptional activity. Moreover, our data show that STAT1 is required for efficient early HCMV-induced enhanced monocyte motility and later for HCMV-induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and for the regulation of macrophage polarization, suggesting that STAT1 may serve as a molecular convergence point linking the biological changes that occur at early and later times postinfection. Taken together, our results suggest that HCMV reroutes the biphasic activation of a traditionally antiviral gene product through an EGFR- and integrin-dependent pathway in order to help promote the proviral activation and polarization of infected monocytes.
   IMPORTANCE HCMV promotes multiple functional changes in infected monocytes that are required for viral spread and persistence, including their enhanced motility and differentiation/polarization toward a proinflammatory M1 macrophage. We now show that HCMV utilizes the traditionally IFN-associated gene product, STAT1, to promote these changes. Our data suggest that HCMV utilizes EGFR-and integrin-dependent (but IFN-independent) signaling pathways to induce STAT1 activation, which may allow the virus to specifically dictate the biological activity of STAT1 during infection. Our data indicate that HCMV utilizes two phases of STAT1 activation, which we argue molecularly links the biological changes that occur following initial binding to those that continue to occur days to weeks following infection. Furthermore, our findings may highlight a unique mechanism for how HCMV avoids the antiviral response during infection by hijacking the function of a critical component of the IFN response pathway.

AB A number of treatment strategies are currently being developed to promote antiretroviral therapy-free HIV cure or remission. While complete elimination of the HIV reservoir would prevent recurrence of infection, it is not clear how different remission lengths would affect viral rebound and transmission. In this work, we use a stochastic model to show that a treatment that achieves a 1-year average time to viral remission will still lead to nearly a quarter of subjects experiencing viral rebound within the first 3 months. Given quarterly viral testing intervals, this leads to an expected 39 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 22 to 69) heterosexual transmissions and up to 262 (95% UI, 107 to 534) homosexual transmissions per 1,000 treated subjects over a 10-year period. Thus, a balance between high initial treatment levels, risk of recrudescence, and risk of transmission should be considered when assessing the "useful" or optimal length of antiretroviral therapy-free HIV remission to be targeted. We also investigate the trade-off between increasing the average duration of remission versus the risk of treatment failure (viral recrudescence) and the need for retreatment. To minimize drug exposure, we found that the optimal target of anti-latency interventions is a 1,700-fold reduction in the size of the reservoir, which leads to an average time to recrudescence of 30 years. Interestingly, this is a significantly lower level of reduction than that required for complete elimination of the viral reservoir. Additionally, we show that when shorter periods are targeted, there is a real probability of viral transmission occurring between tests for viral rebound.
   IMPORTANCE Current treatment of HIV involves patients taking antiretroviral therapy to ensure that the level of virus remains very low or undetectable. Continuous therapy is required, as the virus persists in a latent state within cells, and when therapy is stopped, the virus rebounds, usually within 2 weeks. A major question is how to reduce the amount of persistent virus and therefore allow a delay or remission until the virus returns after ceasing therapy. In this work, we consider the probability that HIV will still rebound even after this reduction and ask what the likelihood of viral transmission would be in this case.

AB While progress has been made in characterizing humoral immunity to Zika virus (ZIKV) in humans, little is known regarding the corresponding T cell responses to ZIKV. Here, we investigate the kinetics and viral epitopes targeted by T cells responding to ZIKV and address the critical question of whether preexisting dengue virus (DENV) T cell immunity modulates these responses. We find that memory T cell responses elicited by prior infection with DENV or vaccination with tetravalent dengue attenuated vaccines (TDLAV) recognize ZIKV-derived peptides. This cross-reactivity is explained by the sequence similarity of the two viruses, as the ZIKV peptides recognized by DENV-elicited memory T cells are identical or highly conserved in DENV and ZIKV. DENV exposure prior to ZIKV infection also influences the timing and magnitude of the T cell response. ZIKV-reactive T cells in the acute phase of infection are detected earlier and in greater magnitude in DENV-immune patients. Conversely, the frequency of ZIKV-reactive T cells continues to rise in the convalescent phase in DENV-naive donors but declines in DENV-preexposed donors, compatible with more efficient control of ZIKV replication and/or clearance of ZIKV antigen. The quality of responses is also influenced by previous DENV exposure, and ZIKV-specific CD8 T cells from DENV-preexposed donors selectively upregulated granzyme B and PD1, unlike DENV-naive donors. Finally, we discovered that ZIKV structural proteins (E, prM, and C) are major targets of both the CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, whereas DENV T cell epitopes are found primarily in nonstructural proteins.
   IMPORTANCE The issue of potential ZIKV and DENV cross-reactivity and how preexisting DENV T cell immunity modulates Zika T cell responses is of great relevance, as the two viruses often cocirculate and Zika virus has been spreading in geographical regions where DENV is endemic or hyperendemic. Our data show that memory T cell responses elicited by prior infection with DENV recognize ZIKV-derived peptides and that DENV exposure prior to ZIKV infection influences the timing, magnitude, and quality of the T cell response. Additionally, we show that ZIKV-specific responses target different proteins than DENV-specific responses, pointing toward important implications for vaccine design against this global threat.

AB The human papillomavirus (HPV) replication cycle is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation. To examine HPV-associated changes in the keratinocyte transcriptome, RNAs isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated cell populations of normal, spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes (NIKS) and NIKS stably transfected with HPV16 episomal genomes (NIKS16) were compared using next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq). HPV16 infection altered expression of 2,862 cellular genes. Next, to elucidate the role of keratinocyte gene expression in late events during the viral life cycle, RNA-Seq was carried out on triplicate differentiated populations of NIKS (uninfected) and NIKS16 (infected). Of the top 966 genes altered (> log(2) = 1.8, 3.5-fold change), 670 genes were downregulated and 296 genes were upregulated. HPV downregulated many genes involved in epithelial barrier function, which involves structural resistance to the environment and immunity to infectious agents. For example, HPV infection repressed expression of the differentiated keratinocyte-specific pattern recognition receptor TLR7, the Langerhans cell chemoattractant CCL20, and proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta. However, the type I interferon regulator IRF1, kappa interferon (IFN-kappa), and viral restriction factors (IFIT1, -2, -3, and -5, OASL, CD74, and RTP4) were upregulated. HPV infection abrogated gene expression associated with the physical epithelial barrier, including keratinocyte cytoskeleton, intercellular junctions, and cell adhesion. Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting confirmed changes in expression of seven of the most significantly altered mRNAs. Expression of three genes showed statistically significant changes during cervical disease progression in clinical samples. Taken together, the data indicate that HPV infection manipulates the differentiating keratinocyte transcriptome to create an environment conducive to productive viral replication and egress.
   IMPORTANCE HPV genome amplification and capsid formation take place in differentiated keratinocytes. The viral life cycle is intimately associated with host cell differentiation. Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) of RNA from undifferentiated and differentiated uninfected and HPV16-positive keratinocytes showed that almost 3,000 genes were differentially expressed in keratinocytes due to HPV16 infection. Strikingly, the epithelial barrier function of differentiated keratinocytes, comprising keratinocyte immune function and cellular structure, was found to be disrupted. These data provide new insights into the virus-host interaction that is crucial for the production of infectious virus and reveal that HPV infection remodels keratinocytes for completion of the virus replication cycle.

AB Many of the approximately 165 proteins encoded by the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome do not have significant similarity to known proteins and have not been studied experimentally. One such protein is DP148R. We showed that the DP148R gene is transcribed at early times postinfection. Deletion of this gene did not reduce virus replication in macrophages, showing that it is not essential for replication in these cells. However, deletion of this gene from a virulent isolate, Benin 97/1, producing the Benin Delta DP148R virus, dramatically reduced the virulence of the virus in vivo. All pigs infected with the Benin Delta DP148R virus survived infection, showing only transient mild clinical signs soon after immunization. Following challenge with the parental virulent virus, all pigs immunized by the intramuscular route (11/11) and all except one immunized by the intranasal route (5/6) survived. Mild or no clinical signs were observed after challenge. As expected, control nonimmune pigs developed signs of acute African swine fever (ASF). The virus genome and infectious virus were observed soon after immunization, coincident with the onset of clinical signs (similar to 10(6) genome copies or 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml). The levels of the virus genome declined over an extended period up to 60 days postimmunization. In contrast, infectious virus was no longer detectable by days 30 to 35. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) was detected in serum between days 4 and 7 postimmunization, and IFN-gamma -producingcells were detected in all pigs analyzed following stimulation of immune lymphocytes with whole virus. ASFV-specific antibodies were first detected from day 10 postimmunization.
   IMPORTANCE African swine fever (ASF) is endemic in Africa, parts of the Trans Caucasus, the Russian Federation, and several European countries. The lack of a vaccine hinders control. Many of the ASF virus genes lack similarity to known genes and have not been characterized. We have shown that one of these, DP148R, is transcribed early during virus replication in cells and can be deleted from the virus genome without reducing virus replication. The virus with the gene deletion, Benin Delta DP148R, caused mild clinical signs in pigs and induced high levels of protection against challenge with the parental virulent virus. Therefore, deletion of this gene can provide a target for the rational development of vaccines.

AB An important goal of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine design is identification of strategies that elicit effective antiviral humoral immunity. One novel approach comprises priming with DNA and boosting with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing HIV-1 Env on virus-like particles. In this study, we evaluated whether the addition of a gp120 protein in alum or MVA-expressed secreted gp140 (MVAgp140) could improve immunogenicity of a DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine. Five rhesus macaques per group received two DNA primes at weeks 0 and 8 followed by three MVA boosts (with or without additional protein or MVAgp140) at weeks 18, 26, and 40. Both boost immunogens enhanced the breadth of HIV-1 gp120 and V1V2 responses, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and low-titer tier 1B and tier 2 neutralizing antibody responses. However, there were differences in antibody kinetics, linear epitope specificity, and CD4 T cell responses between the groups. The gp120 protein boost elicited earlier and higher peak responses, whereas the MVAgp140 boost resulted in improved antibody durability and comparable peak responses after the final immunization. Linear V3 specific IgG responses were particularly enhanced by the gp120 boost, whereas the MVAgp140 boost also enhanced responses to linear C5 and C2.2 epitopes. Interestingly, gp120, but not the MVAgp140 boost, increased peak CD4(+) T cell responses. Thus, both gp120 and MVAgp140 can augment potential protection of a DNA/MVA vaccine by enhancing gp120 and V1/V2 antibody responses, whereas potential protection by gp120, but not MVAgp140 boosts, may be further impacted by increased CD4(+) T cell responses.
   IMPORTANCE Prior immune correlate analyses with humans and nonhuman primates revealed the importance of antibody responses in preventing HIV-1 infection. A DNA prime-modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine has proven to be potent in eliciting antibody responses. Here we explore the ability of boosts with recombinant gp120 protein or MVA-expressed gp140 to enhance antibody responses elicited by the GOVX-B11 DNA prime-MVA boost vaccine. We found that both types of immunogen boosts enhanced potentially protective antibody responses, whereas the gp120 protein boosts also increased CD4(+) T cell responses. Our data provide important information for HIV vaccine designs that aim for effective and balanced humoral and T cell responses.

AB Inhibitory receptors have been extensively described for their importance in regulating immune responses in chronic infections and cancers. Blocking the function of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, Tim-3, and LAG-3 has shown promise for augmenting CD8 T cell activity and boosting pathogen-specific immunity. However, the prevalence of inhibitory receptors on CD4 T cells and their relative influence on CD4 T cell functionality in chronic HIV infection remains poorly described. We therefore determined and compared inhibitory receptor expression patterns of 2B4, CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1, and Tim-3 on virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in relation to their functional T cell profile. In chronic HIV infection, inhibitory receptor distribution differed markedly between cytokine-producing T cell subsets with, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-producing cells displaying the highest and lowest prevalence of inhibitory receptors, respectively. Blockade of inhibitory receptors differentially affected cytokine production by cells in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B stimulation. CTLA-4 blockade increased IFN-gamma and CD40L production, while PD-1 blockade strongly augmented IFN-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and TNF-alpha production. In a Friend retrovirus infection model, CTLA-4 blockade in particular was able to improve control of viral replication. Together, these results show that inhibitory receptor distribution on HIV-specific CD4 T cells varies markedly with respect to the functional subset of CD4 T cells being analyzed. Furthermore, the differential effects of receptor blockade suggest novel methods of immune response modulation, which could be important in the context of HIV vaccination or therapeutic strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Inhibitory receptors are important for limiting damage by the immune system during acute infections. In chronic infections, however, their expression limits immune system responsiveness. Studies have shown that blocking inhibitory receptors augments CD8 T cell functionality in HIV infection, but their influence on CD4 T cells remains unclear. We assessed the expression of inhibitory receptors on HIV-specific CD4 T cells and their relationship with T cell functionality. We uncovered differences in inhibitory receptor expression depending on the CD4 T cell function. We also found differences in functionality of CD4 T cells following blocking of different inhibitory receptors, and we confirmed our results in a Friend virus retroviral model of infection in mice. Our results show that inhibitory receptor expression on CD4 T cells is linked to CD4 T cell functionality and could be sculpted by blockade of specific inhibitory receptors. These data reveal exciting possibilities for the development of novel treatments and immunotherapeutics.

AB HIV-1 infection of noncycling cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), is impaired due to limited availability of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), which are needed for HIV-1 reverse transcription. The levels of dNTPs are tightly regulated during the cell cycle and depend on the balance between dNTP biosynthesis and degradation. SAMHD1 potently blocks HIV-1 replication in DCs, although the underlying mechanism is still unclear. SAMHD1 has been reported to be able to degrade dNTPs and viral nucleic acids, which may both hamper HIV-1 reverse transcription. The relative contribution of these activities may differ in cycling and noncycling cells. Here, we show that inhibition of HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) is associated with an increased expression of p21cip1/waf, a cell cycle regulator that is involved in the differentiation and maturation of DCs. Induction of p21 in MDDCs decreases the pool of dNTPs and increases the antiviral active isoform of SAMHD1. Although both processes are complementary in inhibiting HIV-1 replication, the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 in our primary cell model appears to be, at least partially, independent of its dNTPase activity. The reduction in the pool of dNTPs in MDDCs appears rather mostly due to a p21-mediated suppression of several enzymes involved in dNTP synthesis (i.e., RNR2, TYMS, and TK-1). These results are important to better understand the interplay between HIV-1 and DCs and may inform the design of new therapeutic approaches to decrease viral dissemination and improve immune responses against HIV-1.
   IMPORTANCE DCs play a key role in the induction of immune responses against HIV. However, HIV has evolved ways to exploit these cells, facilitating immune evasion and virus dissemination. We have found that the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in cell cycle regulation and monocyte differentiation and maturation, potentially can contribute to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived DCs through multiple mechanisms. p21 decreased the size of the intracellular dNTP pool. In parallel, p21 prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation and promoted SAMHD1 dNTPase-independent antiviral activity. Thus, induction of p21 resulted in conditions that allowed the effective inhibition of HIV-1 replication through complementary mechanisms. Overall, p21 appears to be a key regulator of HIV infection in myeloid cells.

AB The novel low-pathogenic avian influenza A H7N9 viruses (LPAI H7N9 viruses) have been a threat to public health since their emergence in 2013 because of the high rates of mortality and morbidity that they cause. Recently, highly pathogenic variants of these avian influenza A H7N9 viruses (HPAI H7N9 viruses) have emerged and caused human infections and outbreaks among poultry in mainland China. However, it is still unclear how the HPAI H7N9 virus was generated and how it evolved and spread in China. Here, we show that the ancestor virus of the HPAI H7N9 viruses originated in the Yangtze River Delta region and spread southward to the Pearl River Delta region, possibly through live poultry trade. After introduction into the Pearl River Delta region, the origin LPAI H7N9 virus acquired four amino acid insertions in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein cleavage site and mutated into the HPAI H7N9 virus in late May 2016. Afterward, the HPAI H7N9 viruses further reassorted with LPAI H7N9 or H9N2 viruses locally and generated multiple different genotypes. As of 14 July 2017, the HPAI H7N9 viruses had spread from Guangdong Province to at least 12 other provinces. The rapid geographical expansion and genetic evolution of the HPAI H7N9 viruses pose a great challenge not only to public health but also to poultry production. Effective control measures, including enhanced surveillance, are therefore urgently needed.
   IMPORTANCE The LPAI H7N9 virus has caused five outbreak waves in humans and was recently reported to have mutated into highly pathogenic variants. It is unknown how the HPAI H7N9 virus originated, evolved, and disseminated in China. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the sequences of HPAI H7N9 viruses from 28 human and 21 environmental samples covering eight provinces in China that were taken from November 2016 to June 2017. The results show that the ancestor virus of the HPAI H7N9 viruses originated in the Yangtze River Delta region. However, the insertion of four amino acids into the HA protein cleavage site of an LPAI H7N9 virus occurred in late May 2016 in the Pearl River Delta region. The mutated HPAI H7N9 virus further reassorted with LPAI H7N9 or H9N2 viruses that were cocirculating in poultry. Considering the rapid geographical expansion of the HPAI H7N9 viruses, effective control measures are urgently needed.

AB Ascoviruses are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that attack caterpillars and differ from all other viruses by inducing nuclear lysis followed by cleavage of host cells into numerous anucleate vesicles in which virus replication continues as these grow in the blood. Ascoviruses are also unusual in that most encode a caspase or caspase-like proteins. A robust cell line to study the novel molecular biology of ascovirus replication in vitro is lacking. Therefore, we used strand-specific transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to study transcription in vivo in third instars of Spodoptera frugiperda infected with the type species, Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1a (SfAV-1a), sampling transcripts at different time points after infection. We targeted transcription of two types of SfAV-1a genes; first, 44 core genes that occur in several ascovirus species, and second, 26 genes predicted in silico to have metabolic functions likely involved in synthesizing viral vesicle membranes. Gene cluster analysis showed differences in temporal expression of SfAV-1a genes, enabling their assignment to three temporal classes: early, late, and very late. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP-like proteins; ORF016, ORF025, and ORF074) were expressed early, whereas its caspase (ORF073) was expressed very late, which correlated with apoptotic events leading to viral vesicle formation. Expression analysis revealed that a Diedel gene homolog (ORF121), the only known "virokine," was highly expressed, implying that this ascovirus protein helps evade innate host immunity. Lastly, single-nucleotide resolution of RNA-Seq data revealed 15 bicistronic and tricistronic messages along the genome, an unusual occurrence for large dsDNA viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Unlike all other DNA viruses, ascoviruses code for an executioner caspase, apparently involved in a novel cytopathology in which viral replication induces nuclear lysis followed by cell cleavage, yielding numerous large anucleate viral vesicles that continue to produce virions. Our transcriptome analysis of genome expression in vivo by the Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus shows that inhibitors of apoptosis are expressed first, enabling viral replication to proceed, after which the SfAV-1a caspase is synthesized, leading to viral vesicle synthesis and subsequent extensive production of progeny virions. Moreover, we detected numerous bicistronic and tricistronic mRNA messages in the ascovirus transcriptome, implying that ascoviruses use other noncanonical translational mechanisms, such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). These results provide the first insights into the molecular biology of a unique coordinated gene expression pattern in which cell architecture is markedly modified, more than in any other known eukaryotic virus, to promote viral reproduction and transmission.

TI Heterogeneity of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Major Internal Repeat

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous pathogen of humans that can cause several types of lymphoma and carcinoma. Like other herpesviruses, EBV has diversified through both coevolution with its host and genetic exchange between virus strains. Sequence analysis of the EBV genome is unusually challenging because of the large number and lengths of repeat regions within the virus. Here we describe the sequence assembly and analysis of the large internal repeat 1 of EBV (IR1; also known as the BamW repeats) for more than 70 strains. The diversity of the latency protein EBV nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) resides predominantly within the exons downstream of IR1. The integrity of the putative BWRF1 open reading frame (ORF) is retained in over 80% of strains, and deletions truncating IR1 always spare BWRF1. Conserved regions include the IR1 latency promoter (Wp) and one zone upstream of and two within BWRF1. IR1 is heterogeneous in 70% of strains, and this heterogeneity arises from sequence exchange between strains as well as from spontaneous mutation, with interstrain recombination being more common in tumor-derived viruses. This genetic exchange often incorporates regions of <1 kb, and allelic gene conversion changes the frequency of small regions within the repeat but not close to the flanks. These observations suggest that IR1- and, by extension, EBV-diversifies through both recombination and breakpoint repair, while concerted evolution of IR1 is driven by gene conversion of small regions. Finally, the prototype EBV strain B95-8 contains four nonconsensus variants within a single IR1 repeat unit, including a stop codon in the EBNA-LP gene. Repairing IR1 improves EBNA-LP levels and the quality of transformation by the B95-8 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).
   IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the majority of the world population but causes illness in only a small minority of people. Nevertheless, over 1% of cancers worldwide are attributable to EBV. Recent sequencing projects investigating virus diversity to see if different strains have different disease impacts have excluded regions of repeating sequence, as they are more technically challenging. Here we analyze the sequence of the largest repeat in EBV (IR1). We first characterized the variations in protein sequences encoded across IR1. In studying variations within the repeat of each strain, we identified a mutation in the main laboratory strain of EBV that impairs virus function, and we suggest that tumor-associated viruses may be more likely to contain DNA mixed from two strains. The patterns of this mixing suggest that sequences can spread between strains (and also within the repeat) by copying sequence from another strain (or repeat unit) to repair DNA damage.

AB Zoonotic influenza H7 viral infections have a case fatality rate of about 40%. Currently, no or limited human to human spread has occurred, but we may be facing a severe pandemic threat if the virus acquires the ability to transmit between humans. Novel vaccines that can be rapidly produced for global distribution are urgently needed, and DNA vaccines may be the only type of vaccine that allows for the speed necessary to quench an emerging pandemic. Here, we constructed DNA vaccines encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 (H7N1). In order to increase the efficacy of DNA vaccination, HA was targeted to either major histocompatibility complex class II molecules or chemokine receptors 1, 3, and 5 (CCR1/3/5) that are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC). A single DNA vaccination with APC-targeted HA significantly increased antibody levels in sera compared to nontargeted control vaccines. The antibodies were confirmed neutralizing in an H7 pseudotype-based neutralization assay. Furthermore, the APC-targeted vaccines increased the levels of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, and a single DNA vaccination could confer protection against a lethal challenge with influenza A/turkey/Italy/3889/1999 (H7N1) in mice. In conclusion, we have developed a vaccine that rapidly could contribute protection against a pandemic threat from avian influenza.
   IMPORTANCE Highly pathogenic avian influenza H7 constitute a pandemic threat that can cause severe illness and death in infected individuals. Vaccination is the main method of prophylaxis against influenza, but current vaccine strategies fall short in a pandemic situation due to a prolonged production time and insufficient production capabilities. In contrast, a DNA vaccine can be rapidly produced and deployed to prevent the potential escalation of a highly pathogenic influenza pandemic. We here demonstrate that a single DNA delivery of hemagglutinin from an H7 influenza could mediate full protection against a lethal challenge with H7N1 influenza in mice. Vaccine efficacy was contingent on targeting of the secreted vaccine protein to antigen-presenting cells.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus responsible for sporadic outbreaks of mild and febrile illness in Africa and Asia, reemerged in the last decade causing serious human diseases, including microcephaly, congenital malformations, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Although genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that genetic evolution may have led to the enhanced virulence of ZIKV, experimental evidence supporting the role of specific genetic changes in virulence is currently lacking. One sequence motif, VNDT, containing an N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) protein, is polymorphic; it is absent in many of the African isolates but present in all isolates from the recent outbreaks. In the present study, we investigated the roles of this sequence motif and glycosylation of the E protein in the pathogenicity of ZIKV. We first constructed a stable full-length cDNA clone of ZIKV in a novel linear vector from which infectious virus was recovered. The recombinant ZIKV generated from the infectious clone, which contains the VNDT motif, is highly pathogenic and causes lethality in a mouse model. In contrast, recombinant viruses from which the VNDT motif is deleted or in which the N-linked glycosylation site is mutated by single-amino-acid substitution are highly attenuated and nonlethal. The mutant viruses replicate poorly in the brains of infected mice when inoculated subcutaneously but replicate well following intracranial inoculation. Our findings provide the first evidence that N-linked glycosylation of the E protein is an important determinant of ZIKV virulence and neuroinvasion.
   IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has caused major worldwide public health concern. The virus appears to have gained significant pathogenicity, causing serious human diseases, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The factors responsible for the emergence of pathogenic ZIKV are not understood at this time, although genetic changes have been shown to facilitate virus transmission. All isolates from the recent outbreaks contain an N-linked glycosylation site within the viral envelope (E) protein, whereas many isolates of the African lineage virus lack this site. To elucidate the functional significance of glycosylation in ZIKV pathogenicity, recombinant ZIKVs from infectious clones with or without the glycan on the E protein were generated. ZIKVs lacking the glycan were highly attenuated for the ability to cause mortality in a mouse model and were severely compromised for neuroinvasion. Our studies suggest glycosylation of the E protein is an important factor contributing to ZIKV pathogenicity.

AB B cell subsets with phenotypes characteristic of naive, non-isotypeswitched, memory (B-mem) cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASC) accumulate in various models of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, including viral encephalomyelitis. During neurotropic coronavirus JHMV infection, infiltration of protective ASC occurs after T cell-mediated viral control and is preceded by accumulation of non-isotype-switched IgD(+) and IgM(+) B cells. However, the contribution of peripheral activation events in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) to driving humoral immune responses in the infected CNS is poorly defined. CD19, a signaling component of the B cell receptor complex, is one of multiple regulators driving B cell differentiation and germinal center (GC) formation by lowering the threshold of antigen-driven activation. JHMV-infected CD19(-/-) mice were thus used to determine how CD19 affects CNS recruitment of B cell subsets. Early polyclonal ASC expansion, GC formation, and virus-specific ASC were all significantly impaired in CLN of CD19(-/-) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice, consistent with lower and unsustained virus-specific serum antibody (Ab). ASC were also significantly reduced in the CNS, resulting in increased infectious virus during persistence. Nevertheless, CD19 deficiency did not affect early CNS IgD(+) B cell accumulation. The results support the notion that CD19-independent factors drive early B cell mobilization and recruitment to the infected CNS, while delayed accumulation of virus-specific, isotype-switched ASC requires CD19-dependent GC formation in CLN. CD19 is thus essential for both sustained serum Ab and protective local Ab within the CNS following JHMV encephalomyelitis.
   IMPORTANCE CD19 activation is known to promote GC formation and to sustain serum Ab responses following antigen immunization and viral infections. However, the contribution of CD19 in the context of CNS infections has not been evaluated. This study demonstrates that antiviral protective ASC in the CNS are dependent on CD19 activation and peripheral GC formation, while accumulation of early-recruited IgD(+) B cells is CD19 independent. This indicates that IgD(+) B cells commonly found early in the CNS do not give rise to local ASC differentiation and that only antigen-primed, peripheral GC-derived ASC infiltrate the CNS, thereby limiting potentially harmful nonspecific Ab secretion. Expanding our understanding of activation signals driving CNS migration of distinct B cell subsets during neuroinflammatory insults is critical for preventing and managing acute encephalitic infections, as well as preempting reactivation of persistent viruses during immune-suppressive therapies targeting B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS), such as rituximab and ocrelizumab.

TI Novel Role for Interleukin-17 in Enhancing Type 1 Helper T Cell Immunity

AB It is well established that interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production by CD4(+) T cells is critical for antiviral immunity against herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) genital infection. However, the role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) production by CD4(+) T cells in HSV-2 antiviral immunity is yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that IL-17A plays an important role in enhancing antiviral T helper type 1 (T(h)1) responses in the female genital tract (FGT) and is essential for effective protection conferred by HSV-2 vaccination. While IL-17A did not play a critical role during primary genital HSV-2 infection, seen by lack of differences in susceptibility between IL-17A-deficient (IL-17A(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, it was critical for mediating antiviral responses after challenge/reexposure. Compared to WT mice, IL-17A(-/-) mice (i) infected intravaginally and reexposed or (ii) vaccinated intranasally and challenged intravaginally demonstrated poor outcomes. Following intravaginal HSV-2 reexposure or challenge, vaccinated IL-17A(-/-) mice had significantly higher mortality, greater disease severity, higher viral shedding, and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vaginal secretions. Furthermore, IL-17A(-/-) mice had impaired Th1 cell responses after challenge/reexposure, with significantly lower proportions of vaginal IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) T cells. The impaired T(h)1 cell responses in IL-17A(-/-) mice coincided with smaller populations of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) tissue resident memory T (T-RM) cells in the genital tract postimmunization. Taken together, these findings describe a novel role for IL-17A in regulating antiviral IFN-gamma(+) T(h)1 cell immunity in the vaginal tract. This strategy could be exploited to enhance antiviral immunity following HSV-2 vaccination.
   IMPORTANCE T helper type 1 (T(h)1) immunity, specifically interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production by CD4(+) T cells, is critical for protection against genital herpesvirus (HSV-2) infection, and enhancing this response can potentially help improve disease outcomes. Our study demonstrated that interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plays an essential role in enhancing antiviral T(h)1 responses in the female genital tract (FGT). We found that in the absence of IL-17A, preexposed and vaccinated mice showed poor disease outcomes and were unable to overcome HSV-2 reexposure/challenge. IL-17A-deficient mice (IL-17A(-/-)) had smaller populations of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells in the genital tract postimmunization than did wild-type (WT) mice, which coincided with attenuated T(h)1 responses postchallenge. This has important implications for developing effective vaccines against HSV-2, as we propose that strategies inducing IL-17A in the genital tract may promote more effective T(h)1 cell immunity and better overall protection.

AB The neuroimmune dialogue between peripheral neurons and Langerhans cells (LCs) within mucosal epithelia protects against incoming pathogens. LCs rapidly internalize human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) upon its sexual transmission and then trans-infect CD4(+) T cells. We recently found that the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), secreted mucosally from peripheral neurons, inhibits LC-mediated HIV-1 trans-infection. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CGRP-induced inhibition, focusing on HIV-1 degradation in LCs and its interplay with trans-infection. We first show that HIV-1 degradation occurs in endolysosomes in untreated LCs, and functionally blocking such degradation with lysosomotropic agents results in increased trans-infection. We demonstrate that CGRP acts via its cognate receptor and at a viral postentry step to induce faster HIV-1 degradation, but without affecting the kinetics of endolysosomal degradation. We reveal that unexpectedly, CGRP shifts HIV-1 degradation from endolysosomes toward the proteasome, providing the first evidence for functional HIV-1 proteasomal degradation in LCs. Such efficient proteasomal degradation significantly inhibits the first phase of trans-infection, and proteasomal, but not endolysosomal, inhibitors abrogate CGRP-induced inhibition. Together, our results establish that CGRP controls the HIV-1 degradation mode in LCs. The presence of endogenous CGRP within innervated mucosal tissues, especially during the sexual response, to which CGRP contributes, suggests that HIV-1 proteasomal degradation predominates in vivo. Hence, proteasomal, rather than endolysosomal, HIV-1 degradation in LCs should be enhanced clinically to effectively restrict HIV-1 trans-infection.
   IMPORTANCE During sexual transmission, HIV-1 is internalized and degraded in LCs, the resident antigen-presenting cells in mucosal epithelia. Yet during trans-infection, infectious virions escaping degradation are transferred to CD4(+) T cells, the principal HIV-1 targets. We previously found that the neuroimmune dialogue between LCs and peripheral neurons, innervating mucosal epithelia, significantly inhibits transinfection via the action of the secreted neuropeptide CGRP on LCs. In this study, we investigated whether CGRP-induced inhibition of trans-infection is linked to CGRP-controlled HIV-1 degradation in LCs. We show that in untreated LCs, HIV-1 is functionally degraded in endolysosomes. In sharp contrast, we reveal that in CGRP-treated LCs, HIV-1 is diverted toward and degraded via another cytosolic protein degradative pathway, namely, the proteasome. These results establish that CGRP regulates HIV-1 degradation in LCs. As CGRP contributes to the sexual response and present within mucosal epithelia, HIV-1 proteasomal degradation in LCs might predominate in vivo and should be enhanced clinically.

AB Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a lymphogenic disorder associated with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Key to the survival and proliferation of PEL is the canonical NF-kappa B pathway, which becomes constitutively activated following overexpression of the viral oncoprotein KSHV vFLIP (ks-vFLIP). This arises from its capacity to form a complex with the modulatory subunit of the I kappa B kinase (IKK) kinase, IKK gamma (or NEMO), resulting in the overproduction of proteins that promote cellular survival and prevent apoptosis, both of which are important drivers of tumorigenesis. Using a combination of cell-based and biophysical assays together with structural techniques, we showed that the observed resistance to cell death is largely independent of autophagy or major death receptor signaling pathways and demonstrated that direct targeting of the ks-vFLIP-IKK gamma interaction both in cells and in vitro can be achieved using IKK gamma-mimetic peptides. Our results further reveal that these peptides not only induce cell killing but also potently sensitize PEL to the proapoptotic agents tumor necrosis factor alpha and etoposide and are the first to confirm ks-vFLIP as a tractable target for the treatment of PEL and related disorders.
   IMPORTANCE KSHV vFLIP (ks-vFLIP) has been shown to have a crucial role in cellular transformation, in which it is vital for the survival and proliferation of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an aggressive malignancy associated with infection that is resistant to the majority of chemotherapeutic drugs. It operates via subversion of the canonical NF-kappa B pathway, which requires a physical interaction between ks-vFLIP and the IKK kinase modulatory subunit IKK gamma. While this interaction has been directly linked to protection against apoptosis, it is unclear whether the suppression of other cell death pathways implicated in ks-vFLIP pathogenesis is an additional contributor. We demonstrate that the interaction between ks-vFLIP and IKK gamma is pivotal in conferring resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, we show that the ks-vFLIP-IKK gamma complex can be disrupted using peptides leading to direct killing and the sensitization of PEL cells to proapoptotic agents. Our studies thus provide a framework for future therapeutic interventions.

AB We compared and contrasted pathogenic (in pig-tailed macaques [PTMs]) and nonpathogenic (in African green monkeys [AGMs]) SIVsab infections to assess the significance of the B cell dysfunction observed in simian (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. We report that the loss of B cells is specifically associated with the pathogenic SIV infection, while in the natural hosts, in which SIV is nonpathogenic, B cells rapidly increase in both lymph nodes (LNs) and intestine. SIV-associated B cell dysfunction associated with the pathogenic SIV infection is characterized by loss of naive B cells, loss of resting memory B cells due to their redistribution to the gut, increases of the activated B cells and circulating tissue-like memory B cells, and expansion of the B regulatory cells (Bregs). While circulating B cells are virtually restored to preinfection levels during the chronic pathogenic SIV infection, restoration is mainly due to an expansion of the "exhausted," virus-specific B cells, i.e., activated memory cells and tissue-like memory B cells. Despite of the B cell dysfunction, SIV-specific antibody (Ab) production was higher in the PTMs than in AGMs, with the caveat that rapid disease progression in PTMs was strongly associated with lack of anti-SIV Ab. Neutralization titers and the avidity and maturation of immune responses did not differ between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections, with the exception of the conformational epitope recognition, which evolved from low to high conformations in the natural host. The patterns of humoral immune responses in the natural host are therefore more similar to those observed in HIV-infected subjects, suggesting that natural hosts may be more appropriate for modeling the immunization strategies aimed at preventing HIV disease progression. The numerous differences between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections with regard to dynamics of the memory B cell subsets point to their role in the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV infections and suggest that monitoring B cells may be a reliable approach for assessing disease progression.
   IMPORTANCE We report here that the HIV/SIV-associated B cell dysfunction (defined by loss of total and memory B cells, increased B regulatory cell [Breg] counts, and B cell activation and apoptosis) is specifically associated with pathogenic SIV infection and absent during the course of nonpathogenic SIV infection in natural nonhuman primate hosts. Alterations of the B cell population are not correlated with production of neutralizing antibodies, the levels of which are similar in the two species. Rapid progressive infections are associated with a severe impairment in SIV-specific antibody production. While we did not find major differences in avidity and maturation between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic SIV infections, we identified a major difference in conformational epitope recognition, with the nonpathogenic infection being characterized by an evolution from low to high conformations. B cell dysfunction should be considered in designing immunization strategies aimed at preventing HIV disease progression.

AB Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) make up 8% of the human genome. The HERV type K (HERV-K) HML-2 (HK2) family contains proviruses that are the most recent entrants into the human germ line and are transcriptionally active. In HIV-1 infection and cancer, HK2 genes produce retroviral particles that appear to be infectious, yet the replication capacity of these viruses and potential pathogenicity has been difficult to ascertain. In this report, we screened the efficacy of commercially available reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) at inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HK2 RT and HK2 genomic replication. Interestingly, only one provirus, K103, was found to encode a functional RT among those examined. Several nucleoside analogue RTIs (NRTIs) blocked K103 RT activity and consistently inhibited the replication of HK2 genomes. The NRTIs zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), and lamivudine (3TC), and the nucleotide RTI inhibitor tenofovir (TDF), show efficacy in blocking K103 RT. HIV-1-specific nonnucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase inhibitors (IIs) did not affect HK2, except for the NNRTI etravirine (ETV). The inhibition of HK2 infectivity by NRTIs appears to take place at either the reverse transcription step of the viral genome prior to HK2 viral particle formation and/or in the infected cells. Inhibition of HK2 by these drugs will be useful in suppressing HK2 infectivity if these viruses prove to be pathogenic in cancer, neurological disorders, or other diseases associated with HK2. The present studies also elucidate a key aspect of the life cycle of HK2, specifically addressing how they do, and/or did, replicate.
   IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses are relics of ancestral virus infections in the human genome. The most recent of these infections was caused by HK2. While HK2 often remains silent in the genome, this group of viruses is activated in HIV-1infected and cancer cells. Recent evidence suggests that these viruses are infectious, and the potential exists for HK2 to contribute to disease. We show that HK2, and specifically the enzyme that mediates virus replication, can be inhibited by a panel of drugs that are commercially available. We show that several drugs block HK2 with different efficacies. The inhibition of HK2 replication by antiretroviral drugs appears to occur in the virus itself as well as after infection of cells. Therefore, these drugs might prove to be an effective treatment by suppressing HK2 infectivity in diseases where these viruses have been implicated, such as cancer and neurological syndromes.

AB Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging human pathogen that is the causative agent for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). With MERS outbreaks resulting in over 35% fatalities and now spread to 27 countries, MERS-CoV poses a significant ongoing threat to global human health. As part of its viral genome, MERS-CoV encodes a papain-like protease (PLpro) that has been observed to act as a deubiquitinase and deISGylase to antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) immune pathways. This activity is in addition to its viral polypeptide cleavage function. Although the overall impact of MERS-CoV PLpro function is observed to be essential, difficulty has been encountered in delineating the importance of its separate functions, particularly its deISGylase activity. As a result, the interface of MERS-CoV and human interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (hISG15) was probed with isothermal calorimetry, which suggests that the C-terminal domain of hISG15 is principally responsible for interactions. Subsequently, the structure of MERS-CoV PLpro was solved to 2.4 angstrom in complex with the C-terminal domain of hISG15. Utilizing this structural information, mutants were generated that lacked appreciable deISGylase activity but retained wild-type deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage activities. Hence, this provides a new platform for understanding viral deISGylase activity within MERS-CoV and other CoVs.
   IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), encode a papain-like protease (PLpro) that possesses the ability to antagonize interferon immune pathways through the removal of ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from target proteins. The lack of CoV proteases with attenuated deISGylase activity has been a key obstacle in delineating the impact between deubiquitinase and deISGylase activities on viral host evasion and pathogenesis. Here, biophysical techniques revealed that MERS-CoV PLpro chiefly engages human ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The first structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with this domain exposed the interface between these two entities. Employing these structural insights, mutations were employed to selectively remove deISGylase activity with no appreciable impact on its other deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage biochemical properties. Excitingly, this study introduces a new tool to probe the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and related viruses through the removal of viral deISGylase activity.

AB Dengue virus (DENV) is a major global pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. An improved understanding of the regions within the DENV genome and its encoded proteins that are required for the virus replication cycle will expedite the development of urgently required therapeutics and vaccines. We subjected an infectious DENV genome to unbiased insertional mutagenesis and used next-generation sequencing to identify sites that tolerate 15-nucleotide insertions during the virus replication cycle in hepatic cell culture. This revealed that the regions within capsid, NS1, and the 3' untranslated region were the most tolerant of insertions. In contrast, prM-and NS2A-encoding regions were largely intolerant of insertions. Notably, the multifunctional NS1 protein readily tolerated insertions in regions within the Wing, connector, and beta-ladder domains with minimal effects on viral RNA replication and infectious virus production. Using this information, we generated infectious reporter viruses, including a variant encoding the APEX2 electron microscopy tag in NS1 that uniquely enabled high-resolution imaging of its localization to the surface and interior of viral replication vesicles. In addition, we generated a tagged virus bearing an mScarlet fluorescent protein insertion in NS1 that, despite an impact on fitness, enabled live cell imaging of NS1 localization and traffic in infected cells. Overall, this genomewide profile of DENV genome flexibility may be further dissected and exploited in reporter virus generation and antiviral strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Regions of genetic flexibility in viral genomes can be exploited in the generation of reporter virus tools and should arguably be avoided in antiviral drug and vaccine design. Here, we subjected the DENV genome to high-throughput insertional mutagenesis to identify regions of genetic flexibility and enable tagged reporter virus generation. In particular, the viral NS1 protein displayed remarkable tolerance of small insertions. This genetic flexibility enabled generation of several novel NS1-tagged reporter viruses, including an APEX2-tagged virus that we used in highresolution imaging of NS1 localization in infected cells by electron microscopy. For the first time, this analysis revealed the localization of NS1 within viral replication factories known as "vesicle packets" (VPs), in addition to its acknowledged localization to the luminal surface of these VPs. Together, this genetic profile of DENV may be further refined and exploited in the identification of antiviral targets and the generation of reporter virus tools.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. However, the timing and precise biological mechanisms that are involved in this process are incompletely understood, as are the determinants that influence transmission of particular HCV variants. Here we report results of a longitudinal assessment of HCV quasispecies diversity and composition in 5 cases of vertical HCV transmission, including 3 women coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The population structure of HCV variant spectra based on E2 envelope gene sequences (nucleotide positions 1491 to 1787), including hypervariable regions 1 and 2, was characterized using next-generation sequencing and median-joining network analysis. Compatible with a loose transmission bottleneck, larger numbers of shared HCV variants were observed in the presence of maternal coinfection. Coalescent Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations revealed median times of transmission between 24.9 weeks and 36.1 weeks of gestation, with some confidence intervals ranging into the 1st trimester, considerably earlier than previously thought. Using recombinant autologous HCV pseudoparticles, differences were uncovered in HCV-specific antibody responses between coinfected mothers and mothers infected with HCV alone, in whom generalized absence of neutralization was observed. Finally, shifts in HCV quasispecies composition were seen in children around 1 year of age, compatible with the disappearance of passively transferred maternal immunoglobulins and/or the development of HCV-specific humoral immunity. Taken together, these results provide insights into the timing, dynamics, and biologic mechanisms involved in vertical HCV transmission and inform preventative strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Although it is well established that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted from mother to child, the manner and the moment at which transmission operates have been the subject of conjecture. By carrying out a detailed examination of viral sequences, we showed that transmission could take place comparatively early in pregnancy. In addition, we showed that when the mother also carried human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), many more HCV variants were shared between her and her child, suggesting that the mechanism and/or the route of transmission of HCV differed in the presence of coinfection with HIV-1. These results could explain why cesarean section is ineffective in preventing vertical HCV transmission and guide the development of interventions to avert pediatric HCV infection.

AB Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the RNA debranching enzyme (DBR1) is not required for early steps in HIV cDNA formation but is necessary for synthesis of intermediate and late cDNA products. To further characterize this effect, we evaluated the topology of the 5' end of the HIV-1 RNA genome during early infection with and without inhibition of DBR1 synthesis. Cells were transfected with DBR1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) followed 48 h later by infection with an HIV-1-derived vector containing an RNase H-deficient reverse transcriptase (RT). RNA was isolated at several times postinfection and treated with various RNA-modifying enzymes prior to rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends (5' RACE) for HIV-1 RNA and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). In infected cells, DBR1 knockdown inhibited detection of free HIV-1 RNA 5' ends at all time points. The difference in detection of free HIV-1 RNA 5' ends in infected DBR1 knockdown versus control cells was eliminated by in vitro incubation of infected cell RNAs with yeast or human DBR1 enzyme prior to 5' RACE and qRT-PCR. This was dependent on the 2'-5' phosphatase activity of DBR1, since it did not occur when we used the catalytically inactive DBR1(N85A) mutant. Finally, HIV-1 RNA from infected DBR1 knockdown cells was resistant to RNase R that degrades linear RNAs but not RNAs in circular or lariat-like conformations. These results provide evidence for formation of a lariat-like structure involving the 5' end of HIV-1 RNA during an early step in infection and the involvement of DBR1 in resolving it.
   IMPORTANCE Our findings support a new view of the early steps in HIV genome replication. We show that the HIV genomic RNA is rapidly decapped and forms a lariat-like structure after entering a cell. The lariat-like structure is subsequently resolved by the cellular enzyme DBR1, leaving a 5' phosphate. This pathway is similar to the formation and resolution of pre-mRNA intron lariats and therefore suggests that similar mechanisms may be used by HIV. Our work therefore opens a new area of investigation in HIV replication and may ultimately uncover new targets for inhibiting HIV replication and for preventing the development of AIDS.

AB Since 1999, Caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used to study microbe-host interactions due to its simple culture, genetic tractability, and susceptibility to numerous bacterial and fungal pathogens. In contrast, virus studies have been hampered by a lack of convenient virus infection models in nematodes. The recent discovery of a natural viral pathogen of C. elegans and development of diverse artificial infection models are providing new opportunities to explore virus-host interplay in this powerful model organism.

AB The herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I alkaline nuclease, UL12, has 5' to-3' exonuclease activity and shares homology with nucleases from other members of the Herpesviridae family. We previously reported that a UL12-null virus exhibits a severe defect in viral growth. To determine whether the growth defect was a result of loss of nuclease activity or another function of UL12, we introduced an exonuclease-inactivating mutation into the viral genome. The recombinant virus, UL12 D340E (the D340E mutant), behaved identically to the null virus (AN-1) in virus yield experiments, exhibiting a 4-log decrease in the production of infectious virus. Furthermore, both viruses were severely defective in cell-tocell spread and produced fewer DNA-containing capsids and more empty capsids than wild-type virus. In addition, DNA packaged by the viral mutants was aberrant, as determined by infectivity assays and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We conclude that UL12 exonuclease activity is essential for the production of viral DNA that can be packaged to produce infectious virus. This conclusion was bolstered by experiments showing that a series of natural and synthetic alpha-hydroxytropolones recently reported to inhibit HSV replication also inhibit the nuclease activity of UL12. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the exonuclease activity of UL12 is essential for the production of infectious virus and may be considered a target for development of antiviral agents.
   IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus is a major pathogen, and although nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir are highly effective in controlling HSV-1 or -2 infections in immunocompetent individuals, their use in immunocompromised patients is complicated by the development of resistance. Identification of additional proteins essential for viral replication is necessary to develop improved therapies. In this communication, we confirm that the exonuclease activity of UL12 is essential for viral replication through the analysis of a nuclease-deficient viral mutant. We demonstrate that the exonuclease activity of UL12 is essential for the production of viral progeny and thus provides an attractive, druggable enzymatic target.

AB The Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) belongs to the Tospovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family and represents the sole plant-infecting group within bunyavirus. TSWV encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) which encapsidates the RNA genome to form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). In addition, the N has multiple roles during the infection of plant cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of the full-length TSWV N. The N features a body domain consisting of an N-lobe and a C-lobe. These lobes clamp a positively charged groove which may constitute the RNA binding site. Furthermore, the body domains are flanked by N- and C-terminal arms which mediate homotypic interactions to the neighboring subunits, resulting in a ring-shaped N trimer. Interestingly, the C terminus of one protomer forms an additional interaction with the protomer of an adjacent trimer in the crystal, which may constitute a higher-order oligomerization contact. In this way, this study provides insights into the structure and trimeric assembly of TSWV N, which help to explain previous functional findings, but also suggests distinct N interactions within a higher-order RNP.
   IMPORTANCE TSWV is one of the most devastating plant pathogens that cause severe diseases in numerous agronomic and ornamental crops worldwide. TSWV is also the prototypic member of the Tospovirus genus, which is the sole group of plant-infecting viruses in the bunyavirus family. This study determined the structure of full-length TSWV N in an oligomeric state. The structural observations explain previously identified biological properties of TSWV N. Most importantly, the additional homotypic interaction between the C terminus of one protomer with another protomer indicates that there is a distinct mechanism of RNP formation in the bunyavirus family, thereby enhancing the current knowledge of negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus-encoded N. TSWV N is the last remaining representative N with an unknown structure in the bunyavirus family. Combined with previous studies, the structure of TSWV N helps to build a complete picture of the bunyavirus-encoded N family and reveals a close evolutionary relationship between orthobunyavirus, phlebovirus, hantavirus, and tospovirus.

AB The inhibitors carbobenzoxy (Z)-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly (fusion inhibitor peptide [FIP]) and 4-nitro-2-phenylacetyl amino-benzamide (AS-48) have similar efficacies in blocking membrane fusion and syncytium formation mediated by measles virus (MeV). Other homologues, such as Z-D-Phe, are less effective but may act through the same mechanism. In an attempt to map the site of action of these inhibitors, we generated mutant viruses that were resistant to the inhibitory effects of Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly. These 10 mutations were localized to the heptad repeat B (HRB) region of the fusion protein, and no changes were observed in the viral hemagglutinin, which is the receptor attachment protein. Mutations were validated in a luciferase-based membrane fusion assay, using transfected fusion and hemagglutinin expression plasmids or with syncytium-based assays in Vero, Vero-SLAM, and Vero-Nectin 4 cell lines. The changes I452T, D458N, D458G/V459A, N462K, N462H, G464E, and I483R conferred resistance to both FIP and AS-48 without compromising membrane fusion. The inhibitors did not block hemagglutinin protein-mediated binding to the target cell. Edmonston vaccine/laboratory and IC323 wild-type strains were equally affected by the inhibitors. Escape mutations were mapped upon a three-dimensional (3D) structure modeled from the published crystal structure of parainfluenzavirus 5 fusion protein. The most effective mutations were situated in a region located near the base of the globular head and its junction with the alpha-helical stalk of the prefusion protein. We hypothesize that the fusion inhibitors could interfere with the structural changes that occur between the prefusion and postfusion conformations of the fusion protein.
   IMPORTANCE Due to lapses in vaccination worldwide that have caused localized outbreaks, measles virus (MeV) has regained importance as a pathogen. Antiviral agents against measles virus are not commercially available but could be useful in conjunction with MeV eradication vaccine programs and as a safeguard in oncolytic viral therapy. Three decades ago, the small hydrophobic peptide Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly (FIP) was shown to block MeV infections and syncytium formation in monkey kidney cell lines. The exact mechanism of its action has yet to be determined, but it does appear to have properties similar to those of another chemical inhibitor, AS-48, which appears to interfere with the conformational change in the viral F protein that is required to elicit membrane fusion. Escape mutations were used to map the site of action for FIP. Knowledge gained from these studies could help in the design of new inhibitors against morbilliviruses and provide additional knowledge concerning the mechanism of virus-mediated membrane fusion.

AB RNA viruses accumulate mutations to rapidly adapt to environmental changes. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes various clinical manifestations with occasional severe neurological complications. However, the mechanism by which EV-A71 evolves within the human body is unclear. Utilizing deep sequencing and haplotype analyses of viruses from various tissues of an autopsy patient, we sought to define the evolutionary pathway by which enterovirus A71 evolves fitness for invading the central nervous system in humans. Broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations were observed at the initial infection sites in the respiratory and digestive systems. After viral invasion, we identified a haplotype switch and dominant haplotype, with glycine at VP1 residue 31 (VP1-31G) in viral particles disseminated into the integumentary and central nervous systems. In vitro viral growth and fitness analyses indicated that VP1-31G conferred growth and a fitness advantage in human neuronal cells, whereas VP1-31D conferred enhanced replication in human colorectal cells. A higher proportion of VP1-31G was also found among fatal cases, suggesting that it may facilitate central nervous system infection in humans. Our data provide the first glimpse of EV-A71 quasispecies from oral tissues to the central nervous system within humans, showing broad implications for the surveillance and pathogenesis of this reemerging viral pathogen.
   IMPORTANCE EV-A71 continues to be a worldwide burden to public health. Although EV-A71 is the major etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, it can also cause neurological pulmonary edema, encephalitis, and even death, especially in children. Understanding selection processes enabling dissemination and accurately estimating EV-A71 diversity during invasion in humans are critical for applications in viral pathogenesis and vaccine studies. Here, we define a selection bottleneck appearing in respiratory and digestive tissues. Glycine substitution at VP1 residue 31 helps viruses break through the bottleneck and invade the central nervous system. This substitution is also advantageous for replication in neuronal cells in vitro. Considering that fatal cases contain enhanced glycine substitution at VP1-31, we suggest that the increased prevalence of VP1-31G may alter viral tropism and aid central nervous system invasion. Our findings provide new insights into a dynamic mutant spectral switch active during acute viral infection with emerging viral pathogens.

TI Discrete Dynamical Modeling of Influenza Virus Infection Suggests
   Age-Dependent Differences in Immunity

AB Immunosenescence, an age-related decline in immune function, is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Older hosts exhibit a delayed onset of immunity and prolonged inflammation after an infection, leading to excess damage and a greater likelihood of death. Our study applies a rule-based model to infer which components of the immune response are most changed in an aged host. Two groups of BALB/c mice (aged 12 to 16 weeks and 72 to 76 weeks) were infected with 2 inocula: a survivable dose of 50 PFU and a lethal dose of 500 PFU. Data were measured at 10 points over 19 days in the sublethal case and at 6 points over 7 days in the lethal case, after which all mice had died. Data varied primarily in the onset of immunity, particularly the inflammatory response, which led to a 2-day delay in the clearance of the virus from older hosts in the sublethal cohort. We developed a Boolean model to describe the interactions between the virus and 21 immune components, including cells, chemokines, and cytokines, of innate and adaptive immunity. The model identifies distinct sets of rules for each age group by using Boolean operators to describe the complex series of interactions that activate and deactivate immune components. Our model accurately simulates the immune responses of mice of both ages and with both inocula included in the data (95% accurate for younger mice and 94% accurate for older mice) and shows distinct rule choices for the innate immunity arm of the model between younger and aging mice in response to influenza A virus infection.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza virus infection causes high morbidity and mortality rates every year, especially in the elderly. The elderly tend to have a delayed onset of many immune responses as well as prolonged inflammatory responses, leading to an overall weakened response to infection. Many of the details of immune mechanisms that change with age are currently not well understood. We present a rule-based model of the intrahost immune response to influenza virus infection. The model is fit to experimental data for young and old mice infected with influenza virus. We generated distinct sets of rules for each age group to capture the temporal differences seen in the immune responses of these mice. These rules describe a network of interactions leading to either clearance of the virus or death of the host, depending on the initial dosage of the virus. Our models clearly demonstrate differences in these two age groups, particularly in the innate immune responses.

AB Baculoviruses encode a conserved sulfhydryl oxidase, P33, which is necessary for budded virus (BV) production and multinucleocapsid occlusion-derived virus (ODV) formation. Here, the structural and functional relationship of P33 was revealed by X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional analysis. Based on crystallographic characterization and structural analysis, a series of P33 mutants within three conserved regions, i.e., the active site, the dimer interface, and the R127-E183 salt bridge, were constructed. In vitro experiments showed that mutations within the active site and dimer interface severely impaired the sulfhydryl oxidase activity of P33, while the mutations in the salt bridge had a relatively minor influence. Recombinant viruses containing mutated P33 were constructed and assayed in vivo. Except for the active-site mutant AXXA, all other mutants produced infectious BVs, although certain mutants had a decreased BV production. The activesite mutant H114A, the dimer interface mutant H227D, and the salt bridge mutant R127A-E183A were further analyzed by electron microscopy and bioassays. The occlusion bodies (OBs) of mutants H114A and R127A-E183A had a ragged surface and contained mostly ODVs with a single nucleocapsid. The OBs of all three mutants contained lower numbers of ODVs and had a significantly reduced oral infectivity in comparison to control virus. Crystallographic analyses further revealed that all three regions may coordinate with one another to achieve optimal function of P33. Taken together, our data revealed that all the three conserved regions are involved in P33 activity and are crucial for virus morphogenesis and peroral infectivity.
   IMPORTANCE Sulfhydryl oxidase catalyzes disulfide bond formation of substrate proteins. P33, a baculovirus-encoded sulfhydryl oxidase, is different from other cellular and viral sulfhydryl oxidases, bearing unique features in tertiary and quaternary structure organizations. In this study, we found that three conserved regions, i.e., the active site, dimer interface, and the R127-E183 salt bridge, play important roles in the enzymatic activity and function of P33. Previous observations showed that deletion of p33 results in a total loss of budded virus (BV) production and in morphological changes in occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Our study revealed that certain P33 mutants lead to occlusion bodies (OBs) with a ragged surface, decreased embedded ODVs, and reduced oral infectivity. Interestingly, some P33 mutants with impaired ODV/OB still retained BV productivity, indicating that the impacts on BV and on ODV/OB are two distinctly different functions of P33, which are likely to be performed via different substrate proteins.

AB Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) is a B cell-tropic gammaherpesvirus that can be studied in vivo. Despite viral evasion, type I interferons (IFN-I) limit its spread. After MuHV-4 inoculation into footpads, IFN-I protect lymph node subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSM) against productive infection; after peritoneal inoculation, they protect splenic marginal zone macrophages, and they limit MuHV-4 replication in the lungs. While invasive infections can be used to test specific aspects of host colonization, it is also important to understand natural infection. MuHV-4 taken up spontaneously by alert mice enters them via olfactory neurons. We determined how IFN-I act in this context. Blocking IFN-I signaling did not increase neuronal infection but allowed the virus to spread to the adjacent respiratory epithelium. In lymph nodes, a complete IFN-I signaling block increased MuHV-4 lytic infection in SSM and increased the number of dendritic cells (DC) expressing viral green fluorescent protein (GFP) independently of lytic infection. A CD11c(+) cell-directed signaling block increased infection of DC only. However, this was sufficient to increase downstream infection, consistent with DC providing the main viral route to B cells. The capacity of IFN-I to limit DC infection indicated that viral IFN-I evasion was only partly effective. Therefore, DC are a possible target for IFN-I-based interventions to reduce host colonization.
   IMPORTANCE Human gammaherpesviruses infect B cells and cause B cell cancers. Interventions to block virus binding to B cells have not stopped their infection. Therefore, we must identify other control points that are relevant to natural infection. Human infections are difficult to analyze. However, gammaherpesviruses colonize all mammals. A related gammaherpesvirus of mice reaches B cells not directly but via infected dendritic cells. We show that type I interferons, an important general antiviral defense, limit gammaherpesvirus B cell infection by acting on dendritic cells. Therefore, dendritic cell infection is a potential point of interferon-based therapeutic intervention.

AB Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus that invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets. Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo-and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design.
   IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.

TI Insights into the Impact of CD8(+) Immune Modulation on Human

AB A thorough understanding of the role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) intrahost evolution in AIDS pathogenesis has been limited by the need for longitudinally sampled viral sequences from the vast target space within the host, which are often difficult to obtain from human subjects. CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) provide an increasingly utilized model of pathogenesis due to clinical manifestations similar to those for HIV-1 infection and AIDS progression, as well as a characteristic rapid disease onset. Comparison of this model with SIV-infected non-CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted macaques also provides a unique opportunity to investigate the role of CD8(+) cells in viral evolution and population dynamics throughout the duration of infection. Using several different phylogenetic methods, we analyzed viral gp120 sequences obtained from extensive longitudinal sampling of multiple tissues and enriched leukocyte populations from SIVmac251-infected macaques with or without CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion. SIV evolutionary and selection patterns in non-CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted animals were characterized by sequential population turnover and continual viral adaptation, a scenario readily comparable to intrahost evolutionary patterns during human HIV infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Alternatively, animals that were depleted of CD8(+) lymphocytes exhibited greater variation in population dynamics among tissues and cell populations over the course of infection. Our findings highlight the major role for CD8(+) lymphocytes in prolonging disease progression through continual control of SIV subpopulations from various anatomical compartments and the potential for greater independent viral evolutionary behavior among these compartments in response to immune modulation.
   IMPORTANCE Although developments in combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) strategies have successfully prolonged the time to AIDS onset in HIV-1-infected individuals, a functional cure has yet to be found. Improvement of drug interventions for a virus that is able to infect a wide range of tissues and cell types requires a thorough understanding of viral adaptation and infection dynamics within this target milieu. Although it is difficult to accomplish in the human host, longitudinal sampling of multiple anatomical locations is readily accessible in the SIV-infected macaque models of neuro-AIDS. The significance of our research is in identifying the impact of immune modulation, through differing immune selective pressures, on viral evolutionary behavior in a multitude of anatomical compartments. The results provide evidence encouraging the development of a more sophisticated model that considers a network of individual viral subpopulations within the host, with differing infection and transmission dynamics, which is necessary for more effective treatment strategies.

AB During viral infection, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their associated adaptors recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in production of type I interferons (IFNs). ICP0 and ICP34.5 are among the proteins encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that modulate type I IFN signaling. We constructed a recombinant virus (Delta XX) that lacks amino acids 87 to 106, a portion of the previously described TBK1-binding domain of the gamma 34.5 gene (D. Verpooten, Y. Ma, S. Hou, Z. Yan, and B. He, J Biol Chem 284: 1097-1105, 2009, https://doi. org/10.1074/JBC. M805905200). These 20 residues are outside the gamma 34.5 beclin1-binding domain (BBD) that interacts with beclin1 and regulates autophagy. Unexpectedly, Delta XX showed no deficit in replication in vivo in a variety of tissues and showed virulence comparable to that of wild-type and marker-rescued viruses following intracerebral infection. Delta XX was fully capable of mediating the dephosphorylation of eIF2 alpha, and the virus was capable of controlling the phosphorylation of IRF3. In contrast, a null mutant in gamma 34.5 failed to control IRF3 phosphorylation due to an inability of the mutant to sustain expression of ICP0. Our data show that while gamma 34.5 regulates IRF3 phosphorylation, the TBK1-binding domain itself has no impact on IRF3 phosphorylation or on replication and pathogenesis in mice.
   IMPORTANCE Interferons (IFNs) are potent activators of a variety of host responses that serve to control virus infections. The Herpesviridae have evolved countermeasures to IFN responses. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encodes the multifunctional neurovirulence protein ICP34.5. In this study, we investigated the biological relevance of the interaction between ICP34.5 and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), an activator of IFN responses. Here, we establish that although ICP34.5 binds TBK1 under certain conditions through a TBK1-binding domain (TBD), there was no direct impact of the TBD on viral replication or virulence in mice. Furthermore, we showed that activation of IRF3, a substrate of TBK1, was independent of the TBD. Instead, we provided evidence that the ability of ICP34.5 to control IRF3 activation is through its ability to reverse translational shutoff and sustain the expression of other IFN inhibitors encoded by the virus. This work provides new insights into the immunomodulatory functions of ICP34.5.

AB The size of lentiviral DNA reservoirs reflects the effectiveness of immune responses against lentiviruses. So far, abundant information has been gathered on the control of HIV-1 replication. Understanding the innate mechanisms contributing to containment of the HIV DNA reservoir, however, are only partly clarified and are relevant to guiding interventions for reservoir containment or eradication. We studied the contribution of natural killer (NK) cell functional features in HIV patients controlling replication either spontaneously (HIV controllers [HIC]) or after progression and antiretroviral treatment (progressor patients [PP]). An inverse correlation between HIV DNA copy numbers (either total or integrated) in circulating CD4(+) cells and NK cell function was observed. Induced interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production and NKp46/NKp30 activating receptor-induced expression correlated inversely with reservoir size. The correlation was present not only for a homogeneous cohort of HIC patients but also when PP were included in the analysis. Adaptive (NKG2C(+) CD57(+)) NK cell features were not associated with reservoir size. However, a distinct set of 370 differentially expressed transcripts was found to underlie functional differences in NK cells controlling HIV DNA reservoir size. In proof-of-principle in vitro experiments of CD4(+) cell infection with HIV-1, purified NK cells with the above-mentioned functional/transcriptional features displayed 10- and 30-fold higher abilities to control HIV replication and DNA burdens in vitro, respectively, than those of other NK cells. Thus, NK cells with a specific functional and transcriptional signature contribute to control of the HIV reservoir in CD4(+) cells. Their selection, expansion, and/or adoptive transfer may support strategies to eradicate HIV-1 infection or to safely deescalate antiretroviral treatment.
   IMPORTANCE The most relevant feature of HIV-1 infection is represented by its DNA reservoir size in the body, which guarantees lifelong infection and resumption of virus replication after antiretroviral treatment interruption. So far, there has been little success in the identification of factors contributing to HIV-1 reservoir containment. In this study, by studying quantitative total and integrated HIV-1 DNA levels and NK cells in HIV-1 patients with either progressive or nonprogressive disease, we observed that inducible IFN-gamma and natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) expression in a specific subset of NK cells with a characteristic transcriptional signature represents a correlate for HIV-1 reservoir control. This represents an advance in our understanding of the mechanism(s) that controls the lentivirus reservoir. Monitoring, selection, expansion, and adoptive transfer of these NK cells may allow monitoring of treatment efficacy and the likelihood of reservoir control and may support protocols for HIV-1 eradication.

AB Nipah virus is an emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Human transmission occurs by close contact with infected animals, the consumption of contaminated food, or, occasionally, via other infected individuals. Currently, we lack therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for Nipah virus. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. This aim led us to perform the present work, in which we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), most of which (88) are novel. This data set provides a comprehensive view of the host complexes that are manipulated by viral proteins. Host targets include the PRP19 complex and the microRNA (miRNA) processing machinery. Furthermore, we explored the biologic consequences of the interaction with the PRP19 complex and found that the Nipah virus W protein is capable of altering p53 control and gene expression. We anticipate that these data will help in guiding the development of novel interventional strategies to counter this emerging viral threat. IMPORTANCE Nipah virus is a recently discovered virus that infects a wide range of mammals, including humans. Since its discovery there have been yearly outbreaks, and in some of them the mortality rate has reached 100% of the confirmed cases. However, the study of Nipah virus has been largely neglected, and currently we lack treatments for this infection. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. In the present work, we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions using an affinity purification approach coupled with mass spectrometry. Additionally, we explored the cellular consequences of some of these interactions. Globally, this data set offers a comprehensive and detailed view of the host machinery's contribution to the Nipah virus's life cycle. Furthermore, our data present a large number of putative drug targets that could be exploited for the treatment of this infection.

AB Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 are large, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause lifelong persistent infections characterized by periods of quiescence and recurrent disease. How HSV evolves within an infected individual experiencing multiple episodes of recurrent disease over time is not known. We determined the genome sequences of viruses isolated from two subjects in the Herpevac Trial for Women who experienced primary HSV-2 genital disease and compared them with sequences of viruses isolated from the subsequent fifth or sixth episode of recurrent disease in the same individuals. Each of the HSV-2 genome sequences was initially obtained using next-generation sequencing and completed with Sanger sequencing. Polymorphisms over the entire genomes were mapped, and amino acid variants resulting from nonsynonymous changes were analyzed based on the secondary and tertiary structures of a previously crystallized protein. A phylogenetic reconstruction was used to assess relationships among the four HSV-2 samples, other North American sequences, and reference sequences. Little genetic drift was detected in viruses shed by the same subjects following repeated reactivation events, suggesting strong selective pressure on the viral genome to maintain sequence fidelity during reactivations from its latent state within an individual host. Our results also demonstrate that some primary HSV-2 isolates from North America more closely resemble the HG52 laboratory strain from Scotland than the low-passage-number clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa or laboratory strain 333. Thus, one of the sequences reported here would be a logical choice as a reference strain for inclusion in future studies of North American HSV-2 isolates.
   IMPORTANCE The extent to which the HSV-2 genome evolves during multiple episodes of reactivation from its latent state within an infected individual is not known. We used next-generation sequencing techniques to determine whole-genome sequences of four viral samples from two subjects in the Herpevac Trial. The sequence of each subject's well-documented primary isolate was compared with the sequence of the isolate from their fifth or sixth episode of recurrent disease. Only 19 genetic polymorphisms unique to the primary or recurrent isolate were identified, 10 in subject A and 9 in subject B. These observations indicate remarkable genetic conservation between primary and recurrent episodes of HSV-2 infection and imply that strong selection pressures exist to maintain the fidelity of the viral genome during repeated reactivations from its latent state. The genome conservation observed also has implications for the potential success of a therapeutic vaccine.

TI Epstein-Barr Virus Fusion with Epithelial Cells Triggered by gB Is
   Restricted by a gL Glycosylation Site

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) entry into epithelial cells is mediated by the conserved core fusion machinery, composed of the fusogen gB and the receptor-binding complex gH/gL. The heterodimeric gH/gL complex binds to the EBV epithelial cell receptor or gp42, which binds to the B-cell receptor, triggering gB-mediated fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes. Our previous study found that the gL glycosylation mutant N69L/S71V had an epithelial cell-specific hyperfusogenic phenotype. To study the influence of this gL mutant on the initiation and kinetics of gB-driven epithelial cell fusion, we established a virus-free split-green fluorescent protein cell-cell fusion assay that enables real-time measurements of membrane fusion using live cells. The gL_N69L/S71V mutant had a large increase in epithelial cell fusion activity of up to 300% greater than that of wild-type gL starting at early time points. The hyperfusogenicity of the gL mutant was not a result of alterations in complex formation with gH or alterations in cellular localization. Moreover, the hyperfusogenic phenotype of the gL mutant correlated with the formation of enlarged syncytia. In summary, our present findings highlight an important role of gL in the kinetics of gB-mediated epithelial cell fusion, adding to previous findings indicating a direct interaction between gL and gB in EBV membrane fusion.
   IMPORTANCE EBV predominantly infects epithelial cells and B lymphocytes, which are the cells of origin for the EBV-associated malignancies Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma as well as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Contrary to the other key players of the core fusion machinery, gL has the most elusive role during EBV-induced membrane fusion. We found that the glycosylation site N69/S71 of gL is involved in restricting epithelial cell fusion activity, strongly correlating with syncytium size. Interestingly, our data showed that the gL glycosylation mutant increases the fusion activity of the hyperfusogenic gB mutants, indicating that this gL mutant and the gB mutants target different steps during fusion. Our studies on how gL and gB work together to modulate epithelial cell fusion kinetics are essential to understand the highly tuned tropism of EBV for epithelial cells and B lymphocytes and may result in novel strategies for therapies preventing viral entry into target host cells. Finally, making our results of particular interest is the absence of gL syncytial mutants in other herpesviruses.

AB Seasonal human influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality annually, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses along with other emerging influenza viruses continue to pose pandemic threats. Vaccination is considered the most effective measure for controlling influenza; however, current strategies rely on a precise vaccine match with currently circulating virus strains for efficacy, requiring constant surveillance and regular development of matched vaccines. Current vaccines focus on eliciting specific antibody responses against the hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein; however, the diversity of HAs across species and antigenic drift of circulating strains enable the evasion of virus-inhibiting antibody responses, resulting in vaccine failure. The neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoprotein, while diverse, has a conserved enzymatic site and presents an appealing target for priming broadly effective antibody responses. Here we show that vaccination with parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a promising live viral vector expressing NA from avian (H5N1) or pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus, elicited NA-specific antibody and T cell responses, which conferred protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges. Vaccination with PIV5-N1 NA provided cross-protection against challenge with a heterosubtypic (H3N2) virus. Experiments using antibody transfer indicate that antibodies to NA have an important role in protection. These findings indicate that PIV5 expressing NA may be effective as a broadly protective vaccine against seasonal influenza and emerging pandemic threats.
   IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality annually, while emerging viruses pose potential pandemic threats. Currently licensed influenza virus vaccines rely on the antigenic match of hemagglutinin (HA) for vaccine strain selection, and most vaccines rely on HA inhibition titers to determine efficacy, despite the growing awareness of the contribution of neuraminidase (NA) to influenza virus vaccine efficacy. Although NA is immunologically subdominant to HA, and clinical studies have shown variable NA responses to vaccination, in this study, we show that vaccination with a parainfluenza virus 5 recombinant vaccine candidate expressing NA (PIV5-NA) from a pandemic influenza (pdmH1N1) virus or highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus elicits robust, cross-reactive protection from influenza virus infection in two animal models. New vaccination strategies incorporating NA, including PIV5-NA, could improve seasonal influenza virus vaccine efficacy and provide protection against emerging influenza viruses.

TI Natural Reassortants of Potentially Zoonotic Avian Influenza Viruses

AB The cocirculation of zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 and avian influenza virus (AIV) of subtype H9N2 among poultry in Egypt for at least 6 years should render that country a hypothetical hot spot for the emergence of reassortant, phenotypically altered viruses, yet no reassortants have been detected in Egypt. The present investigations proved that reassortants of the Egyptian H5N1 clade 2.2.1.2 virus and H9N2 virus of the G1-B lineage can be generated by coamplification in embryonated chicken eggs. Reassortants were restricted to the H5N1 subtype and acquired between two and all six of the internal segments of the H9N2 virus. Five selected plaque-purified reassortant clones expressed a broad phenotypic spectrum both in vitro and in vivo. Two groups of reassortants were characterized to have retarded growth characteristics in vitro compared to the H5N1 parent virus. One clone provoked reduced mortality in inoculated chickens, although the characteristics of a highly pathogenic phenotype were retained. Enhanced zoonotic properties were not predicted for any of these clones, and this prediction was confirmed by ferret inoculation experiments: neither the H5N1 parent virus nor two selected clones induced severe clinical symptoms or were transmitted to sentinel ferrets by contact. While the emergence of reassortants of Egyptian HPAIV of subtype H5N1 with internal gene segments of cocirculating H9N2 viruses is possible in principle, the spread of such viruses is expected to be governed by their fitness to outcompete the parental viruses in the field. The eventual spread of attenuated phenotypes, however, would negatively impact syndrome surveillance on poultry farms and might foster enzootic virus circulation.
   IMPORTANCE Despite almost 6 years of the continuous cocirculation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and avian influenza virus H9N2 in poultry in Egypt, no reassortants of the two subtypes have been reported. Here, the principal compatibility of the two subtypes is shown by forcing the reassortment between copassaged H5N1 und H9N2 viruses in embryonated chicken eggs. The resulting reassortant viruses displayed a wide range of pathogenicity including attenuated phenotypes in chickens, but did not show enhanced zoonotic propensities in the ferret model.

AB Activation of innate immunity is essential for host cells to restrict the spread of invading viruses and other pathogens. However, attenuation or termination of signaling is also necessary for preventing immune-mediated tissue damage and spontaneous autoimmunity. Here, we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor X1 (NLRX1) as a negative regulator of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated signaling pathway during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The depletion of NLRX1 enhances the HCV-triggered activation of interferon (IFN) signaling and causes the suppression of HCV propagation in hepatocytes. NLRX1, a HCV-inducible protein, interacts with MAVS and mediates the K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MAVS via the proteasomal pathway. Moreover, poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) interacts with NLRX1 to participate in the NLRX1-induced degradation of MAVS and the inhibition of antiviral responses during HCV infection. Mutagenic analyses further revealed that the NOD of NLRX1 is essential for NLRX1 to interact with PCBP2 and subsequently induce MAVS degradation. Our study unlocks a key mechanism of the fine-tuning of innate immunity by which NLRX1 restrains the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR)-MAVS signaling cascade by recruiting PCBP2 to MAVS for inducing MAVS degradation through the proteasomal pathway. NLRX1, a negative regulator of innate immunity, is a pivotal host factor for HCV to establish persistent infection.
   IMPORTANCE Innate immunity needs to be tightly regulated to maximize the antiviral response and minimize immune-mediated pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we report that NLRX1 is a proviral host factor for HCV infection and functions as a negative regulator of the HCV-triggered innate immune response. NLRX1 recruits PCBP2 to MAVS and induces the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of MAVS, leading to the negative regulation of the IFN signaling pathway and promoting HCV infection. Overall, this study provides intriguing insights into how innate immunity is regulated during viral infection.

AB Apoptosis is an important antiviral host defense mechanism. Here we report the identification of a novel apoptosis inhibitor encoded by the vaccinia virus (VACV) M1L gene. M1L is absent in the attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain of VACV, a strain that stimulates apoptosis in several types of immune cells. M1 expression increased the viability of MVA-infected THP-1 and Jurkat cells and reduced several biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, such as PARP-1 and procaspase-3 cleavage. Furthermore, ectopic M1L expression decreased staurosporine-induced (intrinsic) apoptosis in HeLa cells. We then identified the molecular basis for M1 inhibitory function. M1 allowed mitochondrial depolarization but blocked procaspase-9 processing, suggesting that M1 targeted the apoptosome. In support of this model, we found that M1 promoted survival in Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing human Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, critical components of the apoptosome, or overexpressing only conformationally active caspase-9. In mammalian cells, M1 coimmunoprecipitated with Apaf-1-procaspase-9 complexes. The current model is that M1 associates with and allows the formation of the apoptosome but prevents apoptotic functions of the apoptosome. The M1 protein features 14 predicted ankyrin (ANK) repeat domains, and M1 is the first ANK-containing protein reported to use this inhibitory strategy. Since ANK-containing proteins are encoded by many large DNA viruses and found in all domains of life, studies of M1 may lead to a better understanding of the roles of ANK proteins in virus-host interactions.
   IMPORTANCE Apoptosis selectively eliminates dangerous cells such as virus-infected cells. Poxviruses express apoptosis antagonists to neutralize this antiviral host defense. The vaccinia virus (VACV) M1 ankyrin (ANK) protein, a protein with no previously ascribed function, inhibits apoptosis. M1 interacts with the apoptosome and prevents procaspase-9 processing as well as downstream procaspase-3 cleavage in several cell types and under multiple conditions. M1 is the first poxviral protein reported to associate with and prevent the function of the apoptosome, giving a more detailed picture of the threats VACV encounters during infection. Dysregulation of apoptosis is associated with several human diseases. One potential treatment of apoptosis-related diseases is through the use of designed ANK repeat proteins (DARPins), similar to M1, as caspase inhibitors. Thus, the study of the novel antiapoptosis effects of M1 via apoptosome association will be helpful for understanding how to control apoptosis using either natural or synthetic molecules.

AB An effective AIDS vaccine should elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses while maintaining low levels of CD4(+) T-cell activation to avoid the generation of target cells for viral infection. The present study investigated two prime-boost regimens, both starting vaccination with single-cycle immunodeficiency virus, followed by two mucosal boosts with either recombinant adenovirus (rAd) or fowlpox virus (rFWPV) expressing SIVmac239 or SIVmac251 gag/pol and env genes, respectively. Finally, vectors were switched and systemically administered to the reciprocal group of animals. Only mucosal rFWPV immunizations followed by systemic rAd boost significantly protected animals against a repeated low-dose intrarectal challenge with pathogenic SIVmac251, resulting in a vaccine efficacy (i.e., risk reduction per exposure) of 68%. Delayed viral acquisition was associated with higher levels of activated CD8(+) T cells and Gag-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting CD8(+) cells, low virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses, and low Env antibody titers. In contrast, the systemic rFWPV boost induced strong virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell activity. rAd and rFWPV also induced differential patterns of the innate immune responses, thereby possibly shaping the specific immunity. Plasma CXCL10 levels after final immunization correlated directly with virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses and inversely with the number of exposures to infection. Also, the percentage of activated CD69(+) CD8(+) T cells correlated with the number of exposures to infection. Differential stimulation of the immune response likely provided the basis for the diverging levels of protection afforded by the vaccine regimen.
   IMPORTANCE A failed phase II AIDS vaccine trial led to the hypothesis that CD4(+) T-cell activation can abrogate any potentially protective effects delivered by vaccination or promote acquisition of the virus because CD4(+) T helper cells, required for an effective immune response, also represent the target cells for viral infection. We compared two vaccination protocols that elicited similar levels of Gag-specific immune responses in rhesus macaques. Only the animal group that had a low level of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells in combination with high levels of activated CD8(+) T cells was significantly protected from infection. Notably, protection was achieved despite the lack of appreciable Env antibody titers. Moreover, we show that both the vector and the route of immunization affected the level of CD4(+) T-cell responses. Thus, mucosal immunization with FWPV-based vaccines should be considered a potent prime in prime-boost vaccination protocols.

AB Neuron-virus interactions that occur during herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection are not fully understood. Neurons are the site of lifelong latency and are a crucial target for long-term suppressive therapy or viral clearance. A reproducible neuronal model of human origin would facilitate studies of HSV and other neurotropic viruses. Current neuronal models in the herpesvirus field vary widely and have caveats, including incomplete differentiation, nonhuman origins, or the use of dividing cells that have neuropotential but lack neuronal morphology. In this study, we used a robust approach to differentiate human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells over 2.5 weeks, producing a uniform population of mature human neuronal cells. We demonstrate that terminally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells have neuronal morphology and express proteins with subcellular localization indicative of mature neurons. These neuronal cells are able to support a productive HSV-1 infection, with kinetics and overall titers similar to those seen in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells and the related SK-N-SH cell line. However, terminally differentiated, neuronal SH-SY5Y cells release significantly less extracellular HSV-1 by 24 h postinfection (hpi), suggesting a unique neuronal response to viral infection. With this model, we are able to distinguish differences in neuronal spread between two strains of HSV-1. We also show expression of the antiviral protein cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, which is the first demonstration of the presence of this protein in non-epithelial cells. These data provide a model for studying neuron-virus interactions at the single-cell level as well as via bulk biochemistry and will be advantageous for the study of neurotropic viruses in vitro.
   IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus (HSV) affects millions of people worldwide, causing painful oral and genital lesions, in addition to a multitude of more severe symptoms such as eye disease, neonatal infection, and, in rare cases, encephalitis. Presently, there is no cure available to treat those infected or prevent future transmission. Due to the ability of HSV to cause a persistent, lifelong infection in the peripheral nervous system, the virus remains within the host for life. To better understand the basis of virus-neuron interactions that allow HSV to persist within the host peripheral nervous system, improved neuronal models are required. Here we describe a cost-effective and scalable human neuronal model system that can be used to study many neurotropic viruses, such as HSV, Zika virus, dengue virus, and rabies virus.

AB Our genomes are dominated by repetitive elements. The majority of these elements derive from retrotransposons, which expand throughout the genome through a process of reverse transcription and integration. Short interspersed nuclear elements, or SINEs, are an abundant class of retrotransposons that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, thus generating exclusively noncoding RNA (ncRNA) that must hijack the machinery required for their transposition. SINE loci are generally transcriptionally repressed in somatic cells but can be robustly induced upon infection with multiple DNA viruses. Recent research has focused on the gene expression and signaling events that are modulated by SINE ncRNAs, particularly during gammaherpesvirus infection. Here, we review the biology of these SINE ncRNAs, explore how DNA virus infection may lead to their induction, and describe how novel gene regulatory and immune-related functions of these ncRNAs may impact the viral life cycle.

AB Dengue viruses (DENV) infect 50 to 100 million people each year. The spread of DENV-associated infections is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide, as there is no widely available vaccine or specific therapeutic for DENV infections. To address this, we developed a novel tetravalent dengue vaccine by utilizing virus-like particles (VLPs). We created recombinant DENV1 to -4 (DENV1-4) VLPs by coexpressing precursor membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins, with an F108A mutation in the fusion loop structure of E to increase the production of VLPs in mammalian cells. Immunization with DENV1-4 VLPs as individual, monovalent vaccines elicited strong neutralization activity against each DENV serotype in mice. For use as a tetravalent vaccine, DENV1-4 VLPs elicited high levels of neutralization activity against all four serotypes simultaneously. The neutralization antibody responses induced by the VLPs were significantly higher than those with DNA or recombinant E protein immunization. Moreover, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was not observed against any serotype at a 1: 10 serum dilution. We also demonstrated that the Zika virus (ZIKV) VLP production level was enhanced by introducing the same F108A mutation into the ZIKV envelope protein. Taken together, these results suggest that our strategy for DENV VLP production is applicable to other flavivirus VLP vaccine development, due to the similarity in viral structures, and they describe the promising development of an effective tetravalent vaccine against the prevalent flavivirus.
   IMPORTANCE Dengue virus poses one of the most serious public health problems worldwide, and the incidence of diseases caused by the virus has increased dramatically. Despite decades of effort, there is no effective treatment against dengue. A safe and potent vaccine against dengue is still needed. We developed a novel tetravalent dengue vaccine by using virus-like particles (VLPs), which are noninfectious because they lack the viral genome. Previous attempts of other groups to use dengue VLPs resulted in generally poor yields. We found that a critical amino acid mutation in the envelope protein enhances the production of VLPs. Our tetravalent vaccine elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses against all four DENV serotypes. Our findings can also be applied to vaccine development against other flaviviruses, such as Zika virus or West Nile virus.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading cause of congenital infection and is associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental disabilities and intrauterine growth restriction. Yet our current understanding of the mechanisms modulating transplacental HCMV transmission is poor. The placenta, given its critical function in protecting the fetus, has evolved effective yet largely uncharacterized innate immune barriers against invading pathogens. Here we show that the intrinsic cellular restriction factor apolipoprotein B editing catalytic subunit-like 3A (APOBEC3A [A3A]) is profoundly upregulated following ex vivo HCMV infection in human decidual tissues-constituting the maternal aspect of the placenta. We directly demonstrated that A3A severely restricted HCMV replication upon controlled overexpression in epithelial cells, acting by a cytidine deamination mechanism to introduce hypermutations into the viral genome. Importantly, we further found that A3 editing of HCMV DNA occurs both ex vivo in HCMV-infected decidual organ cultures and in vivo in amniotic fluid samples obtained during natural congenital infection. Our results reveal a previously unexplored role for A3A as an innate anti-HCMV effector, activated by HCMV infection in the maternal-fetal interface. These findings pave the way to new insights into the potential impact of APOBEC proteins on HCMV pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE In view of the grave outcomes associated with congenital HCMV infection, there is an urgent need to better understand the innate mechanisms acting to limit transplacental viral transmission. Toward this goal, our findings reveal the role of the intrinsic cellular restriction factor A3A (which has never before been studied in the context of HCMV infection and vertical viral transmission) as a potent anti-HCMV innate barrier, activated by HCMV infection in the authentic tissues of the maternal-fetal interface. The detection of naturally occurring hypermutations in clinical amniotic fluid samples of congenitally infected fetuses further supports the idea of the occurrence of A3 editing of the viral genome in the setting of congenital HCMV infection. Given the widely differential tissue distribution characteristics and biological functions of the members of the A3 protein family, our findings should pave the way to future studies examining the potential impact of A3A as well as of other A3s on HCMV pathogenesis.

AB Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus comprise two genera of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Despite considerable research efforts, the molecular events following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection are poorly understood. With the view of identifying host factors that underpin EBOV pathogenesis, we compared the transcriptomes of EBOV-infected human, pig, and bat kidney cells using a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. Despite a significant difference in viral transcription/replication between the cell lines, all cells responded to EBOV infection through a robust induction of extracellular growth factors. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor complex members FOS and JUN was observed in permissive cell lines. Functional studies focusing on human cells showed that EBOV infection induces protein expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of JUN and, to a lesser degree, FOS. Using a luciferase-based reporter, we show that EBOV infection induces AP1 transactivation activity within human cells at 48 and 72 h postinfection. Finally, we show that JUN knockdown decreases the expression of EBOV-induced host gene expression. Taken together, our study highlights the role of AP1 in promoting the host gene expression profile that defines EBOV pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Many questions remain about the molecular events that underpin filovirus pathophysiology. The rational design of new intervention strategies, such as postexposure therapeutics, will be significantly enhanced through an in-depth understanding of these molecular events. We believe that new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EBOV may be possible by examining the transcriptomic response of taxonomically diverse cell lines (derived from human, pig, and bat). We first identified the responsive pathways using an RNA-seq-based transcriptomics approach. Further functional and computational analysis focusing on human cells highlighted an important role for the AP1 transcription factor in mediating the transcriptional response to EBOV infection. Our study sheds new light on how host transcription factors respond to and promote the transcriptional landscape that follows viral infection.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is typically acquired asymptomatically in childhood. In contrast, infection later in life often leads to infectious mononucleosis (IM), a febrile illness characterized by anti-EBV IgM antibody positivity, high loads of circulating latently infected B cells, and a marked lymphocytosis caused by hyperexpansion of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells plus a milder expansion of CD56(dim) NKG2A(+) KIR- natural killer (NK) cells. How the two situations compare is unclear due to the paucity of studies on clinically silent infection. Here we describe five prospectively studied patients with asymptomatic infections identified in a seroepidemiologic survey of university entrants. In each case, the key blood sample had high cell-associated viral loads without a marked CD8 lymphocytosis or NK cell disturbance like those seen in patients during the acute phase of IM. Two of the cases with the highest viral loads showed a coincident expansion of activated EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells, but overall CD8(+) T cell numbers were either unaffected or only mildly increased. Two cases with slightly lower loads, in whom serology suggests the infection may have been caught earlier in the course of infection, also showed no T or NK cell expansion at the time. Interestingly, in another case with a higher viral load, in which T and NK cell responses were undetectable in the primary blood sample in which infection was detected, EBV-specific T cell responses did not appear until several months later, by which time the viral loads in the blood had already fallen. Thus, some patients with asymptomatic primary infections have very high circulating viral loads similar to those in patients during the acute phase of IM and a cell-mediated immune response that is qualitatively similar to that in IM patients but of a lower magnitude. However, other patients may have quite different immune responses that ultimately could reveal novel mechanisms of host control.
   IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted orally, replicates in the throat, and then invades the B lymphocyte pool through a growth-transforming latent infection. While primary infection in childhood is usually asymptomatic, delayed infection is associated with infectious mononucleosis (IM), a febrile illness in which patients have high circulating viral loads and an exaggerated virus-induced immune response involving both CD8(+) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Here we show that in five cases of asymptomatic infection, viral loads in the blood were as high as those in patients during the acute phase of IM, whereas the cell-mediated responses, even when they resembled those in patients during the acute phase of IM in timing and quality, were never as exaggerated. We infer that IM symptoms arise as a consequence not of the virus infection per se but of the hyperactivated immune response. Interestingly, there were idiosyncratic differences among asymptomatic cases in the relationship between the viral load and the response kinetics, emphasizing how much there is still to learn about primary EBV infection.

AB A hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo is chronic immune activation concomitant with type I interferon (IFN) production. Although type I IFN induces an antiviral state in many cell types, HIV-1 can replicate in vivo via mechanisms that have remained unclear. We have recently identified a type I IFN-inducible protein, CD169, as the HIV-1 attachment factor on dendritic cells (DCs) that can mediate robust infection of CD4(+) T cells in trans. Since CD169 expression on macrophages is also induced by type I IFN, we hypothesized that type I IFN-inducible CD169 could facilitate productive HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells in cis and CD4(+) T cells in trans and thus offset antiviral effects of type I IFN. In support of this hypothesis, infection of HIV-1 or murine leukemia virus Env (MLVEnv)- pseudotyped HIV-1 particles was enhanced in IFN-alpha-treated THP-1 monocytoid cells, and this enhancement was primarily dependent on CD169-mediated enhancement at the virus entry step, a phenomenon phenocopied in HIV-1 infections of IFN- alpha-treated primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Furthermore, expression of CD169, a marker of type I IFN-induced immune activation in vivo, was enhanced in lymph nodes from pigtailed macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) carrying HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT-SHIV), compared to uninfected macaques, and interestingly, there was extensive colocalization of p27(gag) and CD169, suggesting productive infection of CD169(+) myeloid cells in vivo. While cell-free HIV-1 infection of IFN-alpha-treated CD4(+) T cells was robustly decreased, initiation of infection in trans via coculture with CD169(+) IFN-alpha-treated DCs restored infection, suggesting that HIV-1 exploits CD169 in cis and in trans to attenuate a type I IFN-induced antiviral state.
   IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infection in humans causes immune activation characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN). Although type I IFN induces an antiviral state in many cell types in vitro, HIV-1 can replicate in vivo via mechanisms that have remained unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CD169, a type I IFN-inducible HIV-1 attachment factor, offsets antiviral effects of type I IFN. Infection of HIV-1 was rescued in IFN-alpha-treated myeloid cells via upregulation of CD169 and a subsequent increase in CD169-dependent virus entry. Furthermore, extensive colocalization of viral Gag and CD169 was observed in lymph nodes of infected pigtailed macaques, suggesting productive infection of CD169(+) cells in vivo. Treatment of dendritic cell (DC)-T cell cocultures with IFN-alpha upregulated CD169 expression on DCs and rescued HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T cells in trans, suggesting that HIV-1 exploits CD169 to attenuate type I IFN-induced restrictions.

AB Ecotropic, xenotropic, and polytropic mouse leukemia viruses (E-, X-, and P-MLVs) exist in mice as infectious viruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) inserted into mouse chromosomes. All three MLV subgroups are linked to leukemogenesis, which involves generation of recombinants with polytropic host range. Although P-MLVs are deemed to be the proximal agents of disease induction, few biologically characterized infectious P-MLVs have been sequenced for comparative analysis. We analyzed the complete genomes of 16 naturally occurring infectious P-MLVs, 12 of which were typed for pathogenic potential. We sought to identify ERV progenitors, recombinational hot spots, and segments that are always replaced, never replaced, or linked to pathogenesis or host range. Each P-MLV has an E-MLV backbone with P-or X-ERV replacements that together cover 100% of the recombinant genomes, with different substitution patterns for X-and P-ERVs. Two segments are always replaced, both coding for envelope (Env) protein segments: the N terminus of the surface subunit and the cytoplasmic tail R peptide. Viral gag gene replacements are influenced by host restriction genes Fv1 and Apobec3. Pathogenic potential maps to the env transmembrane subunit segment encoding the N-heptad repeat (HR1). Molecular dynamics simulations identified three novel interdomain salt bridges in the lymphomagenic virus HR1 that could affect structural stability, entry or sensitivity to host immune responses. The long terminal repeats of lymphomagenic P-MLVs are differentially altered by recombinations, duplications, or mutations. This analysis of the naturally occurring, sometimes pathogenic P-MLV recombinants defines the limits and extent of intersubgroup recombination and identifies specific sequence changes linked to pathogenesis and host interactions.
   IMPORTANCE During virus-induced leukemogenesis, ecotropic mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) recombine with nonecotropic endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) to produce polytropic MLVs (P-MLVs). Analysis of 16 P-MLV genomes identified two segments consistently replaced: one at the envelope N terminus that alters receptor choice and one in the R peptide at the envelope C terminus, which is removed during virus assembly. Genome-wide analysis shows that nonecotropic replacements in the progenitor ecotropic MLV genome are more extensive than previously appreciated, covering 100% of the genome; contributions from xenotropic and polytropic ERVs differentially alter the regions responsible for receptor determination or subject to APOBEC3 and Fv1 restriction. All pathogenic viruses had modifications in the regulatory elements in their long terminal repeats and differed in a helical segment of envelope involved in entry and targeted by the host immune system. Virus-induced leukemogenesis thus involves generation of complex recombinants, and specific replacements are linked to pathogenesis and host restrictions.

AB In 2014 and 2015, the United States experienced an unprecedented outbreak of Eurasian clade 2.3.4.4 H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. Initial cases affected mainly wild birds and mixed backyard poultry species, while later outbreaks affected mostly commercial chickens and turkeys. The pathogenesis, transmission, and intrahost evolutionary dynamics of initial Eurasian H5N8 and reassortant H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses in the United States were investigated in minor gallinaceous poultry species (i.e., species for which the U.S. commercial industries are small), namely, Japanese quail, bobwhite quail, pearl guinea fowl, chukar partridges, and ring-necked pheasants. Low mean bird infectious doses (<2 to 3.7 log(10)) support direct introduction and infection of these species as observed in mixed backyard poultry during the early outbreaks. Pathobiological features and systemic virus replication in all species tested were consistent with HPAI virus infection. Sustained virus shedding with transmission to contact-exposed birds, alongside long incubation periods, may enable unrecognized dissemination and adaptation to other gallinaceous species, such as chickens and turkeys. Genome sequencing of excreted viruses revealed numerous low-frequency polymorphisms and 20 consensus-level substitutions in all genes and species, but especially in Japanese quail and pearl guinea fowl and in internal proteins PB1 and PB2. This genomic flexibility after only one passage indicates that influenza viruses can continue to evolve in galliform species, increasing their opportunity to adapt to other species. Our findings suggest that these gallinaceous poultry are permissive for infection and sustainable transmissibility with the 2014 initial wild bird-adapted clade 2.3.4.4 virus, with potential acquisition of mutations leading to host range adaptation.
   IMPORTANCE The outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus that occurred in the United States in 2014 and 2015 represents the worst livestock disease event in the country, with unprecedented socioeconomic and commercial consequences. Epidemiological and molecular investigations can identify transmission pathways of the HPAI virus. However, understanding the pathogenesis, transmission, and intrahost evolutionary dynamics of new HPAI viruses in different avian species is paramount. The significance of our research is in examining the susceptibility of minor gallinaceous species to HPAI virus, as this poultry sector also suffers from HPAI epizootics, and identifying the biological potential of these species as an epidemiological link between the waterfowl reservoir and the commercial chicken and turkey populations, with the ultimate goal of refining surveillance in these populations to enhance early detection, management, and control in future HPAI virus outbreaks.

TI Sorafenib Impedes Rift Valley Fever Virus Egress by Inhibiting
   Valosin-Containing Protein Function in the Cellular Secretory Pathway

ID STRESS
AB There is an urgent need for therapeutic development to combat infections caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which causes devastating disease in both humans and animals. In an effort to repurpose drugs for RVFV treatment, our previous studies screened a library of FDA-approved drugs. The most promising candidate identified was the hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma drug sorafenib. Mechanism-of-action studies indicated that sorafenib targeted a late stage in virus infection and caused a buildup of virions within cells. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown studies suggested that nonclassical targets of sorafenib are important for the propagation of RVFV. Here we extend our previous findings to identify the mechanism by which sorafenib inhibits the release of RVFV virions from the cell. Confocal microscopy imaging revealed that glycoprotein Gn colocalizes and accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the transport of Gn from the Golgi complex to the host cell membrane is reduced. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that sorafenib caused virions to be present inside large vacuoles inside the cells. p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is involved in membrane remodeling in the secretory pathway and a known target of sorafenib, was found to be important for RVFV egress. Knockdown of VCP resulted in decreased RVFV replication, reduced Gn Golgi complex localization, and increased Gn ER accumulation. The intracellular accumulation of RVFV virions was also observed in cells transfected with siRNA targeting VCP. Collectively, these data indicate that sorafenib causes a disruption in viral egress by targeting VCP and the secretory pathway, resulting in a buildup of virions within dilated ER vesicles.
   IMPORTANCE In humans, symptoms of RVFV infection mainly include a self-limiting febrile illness. However, in some cases, infected individuals can also experience hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders, liver failure, and blindness, which could collectively be lethal. The ability of RVFV to expand geographically outside sub-Saharan Africa is of concern, particularly to the Americas, where native mosquito species are capable of virus transmission. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics to treat RVFV infection, and thus, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms by which the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to replicate. The significance of our research is in identifying the cellular target of sorafenib that inhibits RVFV propagation, so that this information can be used as a tool for the further development of therapeutics used to treat RVFV infection.

AB Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to pose an enormous and unpredictable global public health threat, largely due to the continual evolution of escape from preexisting immunity and the potential for zoonotic emergence. Understanding how the unique genetic makeup and structure of IAV populations influences their transmission and evolution is essential for developing more-effective vaccines, therapeutics, and surveillance capabilities. Owing to their mutation-prone replicase and unique genome organization, IAV populations exhibit enormous amounts of diversity both in terms of sequence and functional gene content. Here, I review what is currently known about the genetic and genomic diversity present within IAV populations and how this diversity may shape the replicative and evolutionary dynamics of these viruses.

AB Within infected host cells, mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) forms viral factories (VFs), which are sites of viral transcription, translation, assembly, and replication. The MRV nonstructural protein mu NS comprises the structural matrix of VFs and is involved in recruiting other viral proteins to VF structures. Previous attempts have been made to visualize VF dynamics in live cells, but due to current limitations in recovery of replicating reoviruses carrying large fluorescent protein tags, researchers have been unable to directly assess VF dynamics from virus-produced mu NS. We set out to develop a method to overcome this obstacle by utilizing the 6-amino-acid (CCPGCC) tetracysteine (TC) tag and FlAsH-EDT2 reagent. The TC tag was introduced into eight sites throughout mu NS,and the capacity of the TC-mu NS fusion proteins to form virus factory-like (VFL) structures and colocalize with virus proteins was characterized. Insertion of the TC tag interfered with recombinant virus rescue in six of the eight mutants, likely as a result of loss of VF formation or important virus protein interactions. However, two recombinant (r) TC-mu NS viruses were rescued and VF formation, colocalization with associating virus proteins, and characterization of virus replication were subsequently examined. Furthermore, the rTC-mu NS viruses were utilized to infect cells and examine VF dynamics using live-cell microscopy. These experiments demonstrate active VF movement with fusion events as well as transient interactions between individual VFs and demonstrate the importance of microtubule stability for VF fusion during MRV infection. This work provides important groundwork for future in-depth studies of VF dynamics and host cell interactions.
   IMPORTANCE MRV has historically been used as a model to study the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Reoviridae family, the members of which infect and cause disease in humans, animals, and plants. During infection, MRV forms VFs that play a critical role in virus infection but remain to be fully characterized. To study VFs, researchers have focused on visualizing the nonstructural protein mu NS, which forms the VF matrix. This work provides the first evidence of recovery of replicating reoviruses in which VFs can be labeled in live cells via introduction of a TC tag into the mu NS open reading frame. Characterization of each recombinant reovirus sheds light on mu NS interactions with viral proteins. Moreover, utilizing the TC-labeling FlAsH-EDT2 biarsenical reagent to visualize VFs, evidence is provided of dynamic VF movement and interactions at least partially dependent on intact microtubules.

AB During primary HIV infection, the presence of minority drug resistance mutations (DRM) may be a consequence of sexual transmission, de novo mutations, or technical errors in identification. Baseline blood samples were collected from 24 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive, genetically and epidemiologically linked source and recipient partners shortly after the recipient's estimated date of infection. An additional 32 longitudinal samples were available from 11 recipients. Deep sequencing of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) was performed (Roche/454), and the sequences were screened for nucleoside and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor DRM. The likelihood of sexual transmission and persistence of DRM was assessed using Bayesian-based statistical modeling. While the majority of DRM (> 20%) were consistently transmitted from source to recipient, the probability of detecting a minority DRM in the recipient was not increased when the same minority DRM was detected in the source (Bayes factor [BF] = 6.37). Longitudinal analyses revealed an exponential decay of DRM (BF = 0.05) while genetic diversity increased. Our analysis revealed no substantial evidence for sexual transmission of minority DRM (BF = 0.02). The presence of minority DRM during early infection, followed by a rapid decay, is consistent with the "mutation-selection balance" hypothesis, in which deleterious mutations are more efficiently purged later during HIV infection when the larger effective population size allows more efficient selection. Future studies using more recent sequencing technologies that are less prone to single-base errors should confirm these results by applying a similar Bayesian framework in other clinical settings.
   IMPORTANCE The advent of sensitive sequencing platforms has led to an increased identification of minority drug resistance mutations (DRM), including among antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-infected individuals. While transmission of DRM may impact future therapy options for newly infected individuals, the clinical significance of the detection of minority DRM remains controversial. In the present study, we applied deep-sequencing techniques within a Bayesian hierarchical framework to a cohort of 24 transmission pairs to investigate whether minority DRM detected shortly after transmission were the consequence of (i) sexual transmission from the source, (ii) de novo emergence shortly after infection followed by viral selection and evolution, or (iii) technical errors/limitations of deep-sequencing methods. We found no clear evidence to support the sexual transmission of minority resistant variants, and our results suggested that minor resistant variants may emerge de novo shortly after transmission, when the small effective population size limits efficient purge by natural selection.

TI HIV Fusion in Dendritic Cells Occurs Mainly at the Surface and Is
   Limited by Low CD4 Levels

AB HIV-1 poorly infects monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). This is in large part due to SAMHD1, which restricts viral reverse transcription. Pseudotyping HIV-1 with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) strongly enhances infection, suggesting that earlier steps of viral replication, including fusion, are also inefficient in MDDCs. The site of HIV-1 fusion remains controversial and may depend on the cell type, with reports indicating that it occurs at the plasma membrane or, conversely, in an endocytic compartment. Here, we examined the pathways of HIV-1 entry in MDDCs. Using a combination of temperature shift and fusion inhibitors, we show that HIV-1 fusion mainly occurs at the cell surface. We then asked whether surface levels or intracellular localization of CD4 modulates HIV-1 entry. Increasing CD4 levels strongly enhanced fusion and infection with various HIV-1 isolates, including reference and transmitted/ founder strains, but not with BaL, which uses low CD4 levels for entry. Overexpressing coreceptors did not facilitate viral infection. To further study the localization of fusion events, we generated CD4 mutants carrying heterologous cytoplasmic tails (LAMP1 or Toll-like receptor 7 [ TLR7]) to redirect the molecule to intracellular compartments. The intracellular CD4 mutants did not facilitate HIV-1 fusion and replication in MDDCs. Fusion of an HIV-2 isolate with MDDCs was also enhanced by increasing surface CD4 levels. Our results demonstrate that MDDCs are inefficiently infected by various HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains, in part because of low CD4 levels. In these cells, viral fusion occurs mainly at the surface, and probably not after internalization.
   IMPORTANCE Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs express the HIV receptor CD4 and are potential target cells for HIV. There is debate about the sensitivity of DCs to productive HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. The fusion step of the viral replication cycle is inefficient in DCs, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. We show that increasing the levels of CD4 at the plasma membrane allows more HIV fusion and productive infection in DCs. We further demonstrate that HIV fusion occurs mainly at the cell surface and not in an intracellular compartment. Our results help us understand why DCs are poorly sensitive to HIV infection.

AB Viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) encoded by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is believed to contribute via mitogenic, survival, and angiogenic activities to HHV-8-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms during latency or productive replication. There is direct evidence that vIL-6 promotes latently infected PEL cell viability and proliferation and also viral productive replication in PEL and endothelial cells. These activities are mediated largely through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized vIL-6, which can induce signal transduction via the gp130 signaling receptor, activating mitogen-activated protein kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, and interactions of vIL-6 with the ER membrane protein vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 variant 2 (VKORC1v2). The latter functional axis involves suppression of proapoptotic lysosomal protein cathepsin D by promotion of the ER-associated degradation of ER-transiting, preproteolytically processed procathepsin D. Other interactions of VKORC1v2 and activities of vIL-6 via the receptor have not been reported. We show here that both vIL-6 and VKORC1v2 interact with calnexin cycle proteins UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1), which catalyzes monoglucosylation of N-glycans, and oppositely acting glucosidase II (GlucII), and that vIL-6 can promote protein folding. This activity was found to require VKORC1v2 and UGGT1, to involve vIL-6 associations with VKORC1v2, UGGT1, and GlucII, and to operate in the context of productively infected cells. These findings document new VKORC1v2-associated interactions and activities of vIL-6, revealing novel mechanisms of vIL-6 function within the ER compartment.
   IMPORTANCE HHV-8 vIL-6 prosurvival (latent) and proreplication functions are mediated from the ER compartment through both gp130 receptor-mediated signal transduction and interaction of vIL-6 with the ER membrane protein VKORC1v2. This report identifies interactions of vIL-6 and VKORC1v2 with calnexin cycle enzymes GlucII and UGGT1, which are involved in glycan processing and nascent protein folding. The presented data show that vIL-6 and VKORC1v2 can cocomplex with GlucII and UGGT1, that vIL-6 promotes protein folding, and that VKORC1v2, UGGT1, and vIL-6 interactions with GlucII and UGGT1 are important for the profolding activity of vIL-6, which can be detected in the context of infected cells. This newly identified ER activity of vIL-6 involving VKORC1v2 may promote viral latency (in PEL cells) and productive replication by limiting the damaging effects of unfolded protein response signaling in addition to enhancing viral protein folding. This is the first report of such a function for a cytokine.

AB Human papillomavirus 58 (HPV58) is found in 10 to 18% of cervical cancers in East Asia but is rather uncommon elsewhere. The distribution and oncogenic potential of HPV58 variants appear to be heterogeneous, since the E7 T201/G63S variant is more prevalent in East Asia and confers a 7-to9-fold-higher risk of cervical precancer and cancer. However, the underlying genomic mechanisms that explain the geographic and carcinogenic diversity of HPV58 variants are still poorly understood. In this study, we used a combination of phylogenetic analyses and bioinformatics to investigate the deep evolutionary history of HPV58 complete genome variants. The initial splitting of HPV58 variants was estimated to occur 478,600 years ago (95% highest posterior density [HPD], 391,000 to 569,600 years ago). This divergence time is well within the era of speciation between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans and around three times longer than the modern Homo sapiens divergence times. The expansion of present-day variants in Eurasia could be the consequence of viral transmission from Neanderthals/Denisovans to non -African modern human populations through gene flow. A whole-genome sequence signature analysis identified 3 amino acid changes, 16 synonymous nucleotide changes, and a 12-bp insertion strongly associated with the E7 T201/G635 variant that represents the A3 sublineage and carries higher carcinogenetic potential. Compared with the capsid proteins, the oncogenes E7 and E6 had increased substitution rates indicative of higher selection pressure. These data provide a comprehensive evolutionary history and genomic basis of HPV58 variants to assist further investigation of carcinogenic association and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Papillomaviruses (PVs) are an ancient and heterogeneous group of double -stranded DNA viruses that preferentially infect the cutaneous and mucocutaneous epithelia of vertebrates. Persistent infection by specific oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), including HPV58, has been established as the primary cause of cervical cancer. In this work, we reveal the complex evolutionary history of HPV58 variants that explains the heterogeneity of oncogenic potential and geographic distribution. Our data suggest that HPV58 variants may have coevolved with archaic hominins and dispersed across the planet through host interbreeding and gene flow. Certain genes and codons of HPV58 variants representing higher carcinogenic potential and/or that are under positive selection may have important implications for viral host specificity, pathogenesis, and disease prevention.

AB The highly conserved cytoplasmic tail of influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) contains three cysteines, posttranslationally modified by covalently bound fatty acids. While viral HA acylation is crucial in virus replication, its physico-chemical role is unknown. We used virus-like particles (VLP) to study the effect of acylation on morphology, protein incorporation, lipid composition, and membrane fusion. Deacylation interrupted HA-M1 interactions since deacylated mutant HA failed to incorporate an M1 layer within spheroidal VLP, and filamentous particles incorporated increased numbers of neuraminidase (NA). While HA acylation did not influence VLP shape, lipid composition, or HA lateral spacing, acylation significantly affected envelope curvature. Compared to wild-type HA, deacylated HA is correlated with released particles with flat envelope curvature in the absence of the matrix (M1) protein layer. The spontaneous curvature of palmitate was calculated by molecular dynamic simulations and was found to be comparable to the curvature values derived from VLP size distributions. Cell-cell fusion assays show a strain-independent failure of fusion pore enlargement among H2 (A/Japan/305/57), H3 (A/Aichi/2/68), and H3 (A/Udorn/72) viruses. In contradistinction, acylation made no difference in the low-pH-dependent fusion of isolated VLPs to liposomes: fusion pores formed and expanded, as demonstrated by the presence of complete fusion products observed using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). We propose that the primary mechanism of action of acylation is to control membrane curvature and to modify HA's interaction with M1 protein, while the stunting of fusion by deacylated HA acting in isolation may be balanced by other viral proteins which help lower the energetic barrier to pore expansion.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus is an airborne pathogen causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein abundant on the virion surface, is important in both influenza A virus assembly and entry. HA is modified by acylation whose removal abrogates viral replication. Here, we used cryoelectron tomography to obtain three-dimensional images to elucidate a role for HA acylation in VLP assembly. Our data indicate that HA acylation contributes to the capability of HA to bend membranes and to HA's interaction with the M1 scaffold protein during virus assembly. Furthermore, our data on VLP and, by hypothesis, virus suggests that HA acylation, while not critical to fusion pore formation, contributes to pore expansion in a target-dependent fashion.

AB Many HIV-1-infected patients evolve broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). This evolutionary process typically takes several years and is poorly understood as selection taking place in germinal centers occurs on the basis of antibody affinity. B cells with the highest-affinity receptors tend to acquire the most antigen from the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and present the highest density of cognate peptides to follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which provide survival signals to the B cell. bnAbs are therefore expected to evolve only when the B cell lineage evolving breadth is consistently capturing and presenting more peptides to Tfh cells than other lineages of more specific B cells. Here we develop mathematical models of Tfh cells in germinal centers to explicitly define the mechanisms of selection in this complex evolutionary process. Our results suggest that broadly reactive B cells presenting a high density of peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (pMHC) are readily outcompeted by B cells responding to lineages of HIV-1 that transiently dominate the within host viral population. Conversely, if broadly reactive B cells acquire a large variety of several HIV-1 proteins from the FDC network and present a high diversity of several pMHC, they can be rescued by a large fraction of the Tfh cell repertoire in the germinal center. Under such circumstances the evolution of bnAbs is much more consistent. Increasing either the magnitude of the Tfh cell response or the breadth of the Tfh cell repertoire markedly facilitates the evolution of bnAbs. Because both the magnitude and breadth can be increased by vaccination with several HIV-1 proteins, this calls for experimental testing.
   IMPORTANCE Many HIV-infected patients slowly evolve antibodies that can neutralize a large variety of viruses. Such broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) could in the future become therapeutic agents. bnAbs appear very late, and patients are typically not protected by them. At the moment, we fail to understand why this takes so long and how the immune system selects for broadly neutralizing capacity. Typically, antibodies are selected based on affinity and not on breadth. We developed mathematical models to study two different mechanisms by which the immune system can select for broadly neutralizing capacity. One of these is based upon the repertoire of different follicular helper T (Tfh) cells in germinal centers. We suggest that broadly reactive B cells may interact with a larger fraction of this repertoire and demonstrate that this would select for bnAbs. Intriguingly, this suggests that broadening the Tfh cell repertoire by vaccination may speed up the evolution of bnAbs.

AB In 2014 we observed a noticeable increase in the number of sudden deaths among green tree pythons (Morelia viridis). Pathological examination revealed the accumulation of mucoid material within the airways and lungs in association with enlargement of the entire lung. We performed a full necropsy and histological examination on 12 affected green tree pythons from 7 different breeders to characterize the pathogenesis of this mucinous pneumonia. By histology we could show a marked hyperplasia of the airway epithelium and of faveolar type II pneumocytes. Since routine microbiological tests failed to identify a causative agent, we studied lung tissue samples from a few diseased snakes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). From the NGS data we could assemble a piece of RNA genome whose sequence was < 85% identical to that of nidoviruses previously identified in ball pythons and Indian pythons. We then employed reverse transcription-PCR to demonstrate the presence of the novel nidovirus in all diseased snakes. To attempt virus isolation, we established primary cultures of Morelia viridis liver and brain cells, which we inoculated with homogenates of lung tissue from infected individuals. Ultrastructural examination of concentrated cell culture supernatants showed the presence of nidovirus particles, and subsequent NGS analysis yielded the full genome of the novel virus Morelia viridis nidovirus (MVNV). We then generated an antibody against MVNV nucleoprotein, which we used alongside RNA in situ hybridization to demonstrate viral antigen and RNA in the affected lungs. This suggests that in natural infection MVNV damages the respiratory tract epithelium, which then results in epithelial hyperplasia, most likely as an exaggerated regenerative attempt in association with increased epithelial turnover.
   IMPORTANCE Novel nidoviruses associated with severe respiratory disease were fairly recently identified in ball pythons and Indian pythons. Herein we report on the isolation and identification of a further nidovirus from green tree pythons (Morelia viridis) with fatal pneumonia. We thoroughly characterized the pathological changes in the infected individuals and show that nidovirus infection is associated with marked epithelial proliferation in the respiratory tract. We speculate that this and the associated excess mucus production can lead to the animals' death by inhibiting normal gas exchange in the lungs. The virus was predominantly detected in the respiratory tract, which renders transmission via the respiratory route likely. Nidoviruses cause sudden outbreaks with high rates of mortality in breeding collections, and most affected snakes die without prior clinical signs. These findings, together with those of other groups, indicate that nidoviruses are a likely cause of severe pneumonia in pythons.

However, few studies have identified biomarkers for monitoring infections using in vivo imaging. Previously, we demonstrated that positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) can monitor monkeypox disease progression in vivo in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, we investigated [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT imaging of immune processes in lymphoid tissues to identify patterns of inflammation in the monkepox NHP model and to determine the value of [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT as a biomarker for disease and treatment outcomes. Quantitative analysis of [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT images revealed differences between moribund and surviving animals at two sites vital to the immune response to viral infections, bone marrow and lymph nodes (LNs). Moribund NHPs demonstrated increased [F-18]-FDG uptake in bone marrow 4 days postinfection compared to surviving NHPs. In surviving, treated NHPs, increase in LN volume correlated with [F-18]FDG uptake and peaked 10 days postinfection, while minimal lymphadenopathy and higher glycolytic activity were observed in moribund NHPs early in infection. Imaging data were supported by standard virology, pathology, and immunology findings. Even with the limited number of subjects, imaging was able to differentiate the difference between disease outcomes, warranting additional studies to demonstrate whether [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT can identify other, subtler effects. Visualizing altered metabolic activity at sites involved in the immune response by [F-18]-FDG-PET/CT imaging is a powerful tool for identifying key disease-specific time points and locations that are most relevant for pathogenesis and treatment.
   IMPORTANCE Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is a universal tool in oncology and neuroscience. The application of this technology to infectious diseases is far less developed. We used PET/CT imaging with [F-18]-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([F-18]-FDG) in monkeys after monkeypox virus exposure to monitor the immune response in lymphoid tissues. In lymph nodes of surviving monkeys, changes in [F-18]-FDG uptake positively correlated with enlargement of the lymph nodes and peaked on day 10 postinfection. In contrast, the bone marrow and lymph nodes of nonsurvivors showed increased [F-18]-FDG uptake by day 4 postinfection with minimal lymph node enlargement, indicating that elevated cell metabolic activity early after infection is predictive of disease outcome. [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging can provide real-time snapshots of metabolic activity changes in response to viral infections and identify key time points and locations most relevant for monitoring the development of pathogenesis and for potential treatment to be effective.

TI Mutation of the Putative Immunosuppressive Domain of the Retroviral
   Envelope Glycoprotein Compromises Infectivity

AB The envelope glycoprotein of diverse endogenous and exogenous retroviruses is considered inherently immunosuppressive. Extensive work mapped the immunosuppressive activity to a highly conserved domain, termed the immunosuppressive domain (ISD), in the transmembrane (TM) subunit of the envelope glycoprotein and identified two naturally polymorphic key residues that afford immunosuppressive activity to distinct envelope glycoproteins. Concurrent mutation of these two key residues (E14R and A20F) in the envelope glycoprotein of the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) ISD has been reported to abolish its immunosuppressive activity, without affecting its fusogenicity, and to weaken the ability of the virus to replicate specifically in immunocompetent hosts. Here, we show that mutation of these key residues did, in fact, result in a substantial loss of F-MLV infectivity, independently of host immunity, challenging whether associations exist between the two. Notably, a loss of infectivity incurred by the F-MLV mutant with the E14R and A20F double ISD mutation was conditional on expression of the ecotropic envelope receptor murine cationic amino acid transporter-1 (mCAT1) in the virus-producing cell. Indeed, the F-MLV mutant retained infectivity when it was produced by human cells, which naturally lack mCAT1 expression, but not by murine cells. Furthermore, mCAT1 overexpression in human cells impaired the infectivity of both the F-MLV double mutant and the wild-type F-MLV strain, suggesting a finely tuned relationship between the levels of mCAT1 in the producer cell and the infectivity of the virions produced. An adverse effect on this relationship, rather than disruption of the putative ISD, is therefore more likely to explain the loss of F-MLV infectivity incurred by mutations in key ISD residues E14 and A20.
   IMPORTANCE Retroviruses can interact with their hosts in ways that, although not entirely understood, can greatly influence their pathogenic potential. One such example is a putative immunosuppressive activity, which has been mapped to a conserved domain of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein of several exogenous as well as endogenous retroviruses. In this study, mutations naturally found in some envelope glycoproteins lacking immunosuppressive activity were shown to affect retrovirus infectivity only if the host cell that produced the retrovirus also expressed the cellular entry receptor. These findings shed light on a novel role for this conserved domain in providing the necessary stability to the envelope glycoprotein in order to withstand the interaction with the cellular receptor during virus formation. This function of the domain is critical for further elucidation of the mechanism of immunosuppression mediated by the retroviral envelope glycoprotein.

AB Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), an important bovine pathogen, establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons. Latently infected calves consistently reactivate from latency following a single intravenous injection of the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone. The immediate early transcription unit 1 (IEtu1) promoter, which drives bovine ICP0 (bICP0) and bICP4 expression, is stimulated by dexamethasone because it contains two glucocorticoid receptor (GR) response elements (GREs). Several Kruppel-like transcription factors (KLF), including KLF15, are induced during reactivation from latency, and they stimulate certain viral promoters and productive infection. In this study, we demonstrate that the GR and KLF15 were frequently expressed in the same trigeminal ganglion (TG) neuron during reactivation and cooperatively stimulated productive infection and IEtu1 GREs in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2A). We further hypothesized that additional regions in the BoHV-1 genome are transactivated by the GR or stress-induced transcription factors. To test this hypothesis, BoHV-1 DNA fragments (less than 400 bp) containing potential GR and KLF binding sites were identified and examined for transcriptional activation by stress-induced transcription factors. Intergenic regions within the unique long 52 gene (UL52; a component of the DNA primase/helicase complex), bICP4, IEtu2, and the unique short region were stimulated by KLF15 and the GR. Chromatin immuno-precipitation studies revealed that the GR and KLF15 interacted with sequences within IEtu1 GREs and the UL52 fragment. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that KLF15 and the GR were associated with each other in transfected cells. Since the GR stimulates KLF15 expression, we suggest that these two transcription factors form a feed-forward loop that stimulates viral gene expression and productive infection following stressful stimuli.
   IMPORTANCE Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is an important viral pathogen that causes respiratory disease and suppresses immune responses in cattle; consequently, life-threatening bacterial pneumonia can occur. Following acute infection, BoHV-1 establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons. Reactivation from latency is initiated by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone. Dexamethasone stimulates lytic cycle viral gene expression in sensory neurons of calves latently infected with BoHV-1, culminating in virus shedding and transmission. Two stress-induced cellular transcription factors, Kruppel-like transcription factor 15 (KLF15) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), cooperate to stimulate productive infection and viral transcription. Additional studies demonstrated that KLF15 and the GR form a stable complex and that these stress-induced transcription factors bind to viral DNA sequences, which correlates with transcriptional activation. The ability of the GR and KLF15 to synergistically stimulate viral gene expression and productive infection may be critical for the ability of BoHV-1 to reactivate from latency following stressful stimuli.

AB NK cells are innate lymphocytes that participate in many immune processes encompassing cancer, bacterial and fungal infection, autoimmunity, and even pregnancy and that specialize in antiviral defense. NK cells express inhibitory and activating receptors and kill their targets when activating signals overpower inhibitory signals. The NK cell inhibitory receptors include a uniquely diverse array of proteins named killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR5), the CD94 family, and the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LIR) family. The NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize mostly major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (MHC-I) proteins. Zika virus has recently emerged as a major threat due to its association with birth defects and its pandemic potential. How Zika virus interacts with the immune system, and especially with NK cells, is unclear. Here we show that Zika virus infection is barely sensed by NK cells, since little or no increase in the expression of activating NK cell ligands was observed following Zika infection. In contrast, we demonstrate that Zika virus infection leads to the upregulation of MHC class I proteins and consequently to the inhibition of NK cell killing. Mechanistically, we show that MHC class I proteins are upregulated via the RIGI-IRF3 pathway and that this upregulation is mediated via beta interferon (IFN-beta). Potentially, countering MHC class I upregulation during Zika virus infection could be used as a prophylactic treatment against Zika virus.
   IMPORTANCE NK cells are innate lymphocytes that recognize and eliminate various pathogens and are known mostly for their role in controlling viral infections. NK cells express inhibitory and activating receptors, and they kill or spare their targets based on the integration of inhibitory and activating signals. Zika virus has recently emerged as a major threat to humans due to its pandemic potential and its association with birth defects. The role of NK cells in Zika virus infection is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Zika virus infection is almost undetected by NK cells, as evidenced by the fact that the expression of activating ligands for NK cells is not induced following Zika infection. We identified a mechanism whereby Zika virus sensing via the RIGI-IRF3 pathway resulted in IFN-beta-mediated upregulation of MHC-I molecules and inhibition of NK cell activity. Countering MHC class I upregulation and boosting NK cell activity may be employed as prophylactic measures to combat Zika virus infection.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB CM2 is the second membrane protein of the influenza C virus and has been demonstrated to play a role in the uncoating and genome packaging processes in influenza C virus replication. Although the effects of N-linked glycosylation, disulfide-linked oligomerization, and palmitoylation of CM2 on virus replication have been analyzed, the effect of the phosphorylation of CM2 on virus replication remains to be determined. In this study, a phosphorylation site(s) at residue 78 and/or 103 of CM2 was replaced with an alanine residue(s), and the effects of the loss of phosphorylation on influenza C virus replication were analyzed. No significant differences were observed in the packaging of the reporter gene between influenza C virus-like particles (VLPs) produced from 293T cells expressing wild-type CM2 and those from the cells expressing the CM2 mutants lacking the phosphorylation site(s). Reporter gene expression in HMV-II cells infected with VLPs containing the CM2 mutants was inhibited in comparison with that in cells infected with wild-type VLPs. The virus production of the recombinant influenza C virus possessing CM2 mutants containing a serine-to-alanine change at residue 78 was significantly lower than that of wild-type recombinant influenza C virus. Furthermore, the virus growth of the recombinant viruses possessing CM2 with a serine-to-aspartic acid change at position 78, to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, was virtually identical to that of the wild type virus. These results suggest that phosphorylation of CM2 plays a role in efficient virus replication, probably through the addition of a negative charge to the Ser78 phosphorylation site.
   IMPORTANCE It is well-known that many host and viral proteins are posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation, which plays a role in the functions of these proteins. In influenza A and B viruses, phosphorylation of viral proteins NP, M1, NS1, and the nuclear export protein (NEP), which are not integrated into the membranes, affects the functions of these proteins, thereby affecting virus replication. However, it was reported that phosphorylation of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel protein, which is integrated into the membrane, has no effect on virus replication in vitro or in vivo. We previously demonstrated that the influenza C virus CM2 ion channel protein is modified by N-glycosylation, oligomerization, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation and have analyzed the effects of these modifications, except phosphorylation, on virus replication. This is the first report demonstrating that phosphorylation of the influenza C virus CM2 ion channel protein, unlike that of the influenza A virus M2 protein, plays a role in virus replication.

AB Dominant antibody responses in vaccinees who received the HIV-1 multiclade (A, B, and C) envelope (Env) DNA/recombinant adenovirus virus type 5 (rAd5) vaccine studied in HIV-1 Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) efficacy trial 505 (HVTN 505) targeted Env gp41 and cross-reacted with microbial antigens. In this study, we asked if the DNA/rAd5 vaccine induced a similar antibody response in rhesus macaques (RMs), which are commonly used as an animal model for human HIV-1 infections and for testing candidate HIV-1 vaccines. We also asked if gp41 immunodominance could be avoided by immunization of neonatal RMs during the early stages of microbial colonization. We found that the DNA/rAd5 vaccine elicited a higher frequency of gp41-reactive memory B cells than gp120-memory B cells in adult and neonatal RMs. Analysis of the vaccine-induced Env-reactive B cell repertoire revealed that the majority of HIV-1 Env-reactive antibodies in both adult and neonatal RMs were targeted to gp41. Interestingly, a subset of gp41-reactive antibodies isolated from RMs cross-reacted with host antigens, including autologous intestinal microbiota. Thus, gp41-containing DNA/rAd5 vaccine induced dominant gp41-microbiota cross-reactive antibodies derived from blood memory B cells in RMs as observed in the HVTN 505 vaccine efficacy trial. These data demonstrated that RMs can be used to investigate gp41 immunodominance in candidate HIV-1 vaccines. Moreover, colonization of neonatal RMs occurred within the first week of life, and immunization of neonatal RMs during this time also induced a dominant gp41-reactive antibody response.
   IMPORTANCE Our results are critical to current work in the HIV-1 vaccine field evaluating the phenomenon of gp41 immunodominance induced by HIV-1 Env gp140 in RMs and humans. Our data demonstrate that RMs are an appropriate animal model to study this phenomenon and to determine the immunogenicity in new HIV-1 Env trimer vaccine designs. The demonstration of gp41 immunodominance in memory B cells of both adult and neonatal RMs indicated that early vaccination could not overcome gp41 dominant responses.

AB Effective CD8(+) T cell responses play an important role in determining the course of a viral infection. Overwhelming antigen exposure can result in suboptimal CD8(+) T cell responses, leading to chronic infection. This altered CD8(+) T cell differentiation state, termed exhaustion, is characterized by reduced effector function, upregulation of inhibitory receptors, and altered expression of transcription factors. Prevention of overwhelming antigen exposure to limit CD8(+) T cell exhaustion is of significant interest for the control of chronic infection. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) is a component of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling downstream of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR). Using acute infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strain Armstrong, we show here that IRF9 limited early LCMV replication by regulating expression of interferon-stimulated genes and IFN-I and by controlling levels of IRF7, a transcription factor essential for IFN-I production. Infection of IRF9- or IFNAR-deficient mice led to a loss of early restriction of viral replication and impaired antiviral responses in dendritic cells, resulting in CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and chronic infection. Differences in the antiviral activities of IRF9- and IFNAR-deficient mice and dendritic cells provided further evidence of IRF9-independent IFN-I signaling. Thus, our findings illustrate a CD8(+) T cell extrinsic function for IRF9, as a signaling factor downstream of IFNAR, in preventing overwhelming antigen exposure resulting in CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and, ultimately, chronic infection.
   IMPORTANCE During early viral infection, overwhelming antigen exposure can cause functional exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells and lead to chronic infection. Here we show that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) plays a decisive role in preventing CD8(+) T cell exhaustion. Using acute infection of mice with LCMV strain Armstrong, we found that IRF9 limited early LCMV replication by regulating expression of interferon-stimulated genes and Irf7, encoding a transcription factor crucial for type I interferon (IFN-I) production, as well as by controlling the levels of IFN-I. Infection of IRF9-deficient mice led to a chronic infection that was accompanied by CD8(+) T cell exhaustion due to defects extrinsic to T cells. Our findings illustrate an essential role for IRF9, as a mediator downstream of IFNAR, in preventing overwhelming antigen exposure causing CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and leading to chronic viral infection.

TI Zinc Salts Block Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the
   Activity of Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY

   ALPHA; INITIATION
AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.

TI Reverse Genetics System Demonstrates that Rotavirus Nonstructural

AB The use of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) to synthesize more than one unique protein from a single mRNA has been described for several viruses. Segment 11 of the rotavirus genome encodes two nonstructural proteins, NSP5 and NSP6. The NSP6 ORF is present in the vast majority of rotavirus strains, and therefore the NSP6 protein would be expected to have a function in viral replication. However, there is no direct evidence of its function or requirement in the viral replication cycle yet. Here, taking advantage of a recently established plasmid-only-based reverse genetics system that allows rescue of recombinant rotaviruses entirely from cloned cDNAs, we generated NSP6-deficient viruses to directly address its significance in the viral replication cycle. Viable recombinant NSP6-deficient viruses could be engineered. Single-step growth curves and plaque formation of the NSP6-deficient viruses confirmed that NSP6 expression is of limited significance for RVA replication in cell culture, although the NSP6 protein seemed to promote efficient virus growth.
   IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is one of the most important pathogens of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. The rotavirus genome, consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, encodes six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). Although specific functions have been ascribed to each of the 12 viral proteins, the role of NSP6 in the viral replication cycle remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the NSP6 protein is not essential for viral replication in cell culture by using a recently developed plasmidonly-based reverse genetics system. This reverse genetics approach will be successfully applied to answer questions of great interest regarding the roles of rotaviral proteins in replication and pathogenicity, which can hardly be addressed by conventional approaches.

AB Accumulation of fibrillar protein aggregates is a hallmark of many diseases. While numerous proteins form fibrils by prion-like seeded polymerization in vitro, only some are transmissible and pathogenic in vivo. To probe the structural features that confer transmissibility to prion protein (PrP) fibrils, we have analyzed synthetic PrP amyloids with or without the human prion disease-associated P102L mutation. The formation of infectious prions from PrP molecules in vitro has required cofactors and/or unphysiological denaturing conditions. Here, we demonstrate that, under physiologically compatible conditions without cofactors, the P102L mutation in recombinant hamster PrP promoted prion formation when seeded by minute amounts of scrapie prions in vitro. Surprisingly, combination of the P102L mutation with charge-neutralizing substitutions of four nearby lysines promoted spontaneous prion formation. When inoculated into hamsters, both of these types of synthetic prions initiated substantial accumulation of prion seeding activity and protease-resistant PrP without transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) clinical signs or notable glial activation. Our evidence suggests that PrP's centrally located proline and lysine residues act as conformational switches in the in vitro formation of transmissible PrP amyloids.
   IMPORTANCE Many diseases involve the damaging accumulation of specific misfolded proteins in thread-like aggregates. These threads (fibrils) are capable of growing on the ends by seeding the refolding and incorporation of the normal form of the given protein. In many cases such aggregates can be infectious and propagate like prions when transmitted from one individual host to another. Some transmitted aggregates can cause fatal disease, as with human iatrogenic prion diseases, while other aggregates appear to be relatively innocuous. The factors that distinguish infectious and pathogenic protein aggregates from more innocuous ones are poorly understood. Here we have compared the combined effects of prion seeding and mutations of prion protein (PrP) on the structure and transmission properties of synthetic PrP aggregates. Our results highlight the influence of specific sequence features in the normally unstructured region of PrP that influence the infectious and neuropathogenic properties of PrP-derived aggregates.

AB Endoglin is part of the TGF-beta receptor complex and has a crucial role in fibrogenesis and angiogenesis. It is also an important protein for tumor growth, survival, and cancer cell metastasis. In a previous study, we have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties in human hepatocytes. Our array data suggested that endoglin (CD105) mRNA is significantly upregulated in HCV-associated CSCs. In this study, we have observed increased endoglin expression on the cell surface of an HCV core-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line or immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) and activation of its downstream signaling molecules. The status of phospho-SMAD1/ 5 and the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 (ID1) were upregulated in HCV-infected cells or viral core gene-transfected cells. Additionally, we observed upregulation of endoglin/ ID1 mRNA expression in chronic HCV patient liver biopsy samples. CSC generation by HCV core protein was dependent on the endoglin signaling pathway using activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) Fc blocking peptide and endoglin small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further, follow-up from in vitro analysis suggested that the antiapoptosis Bcl2 protein, proliferationrelated cyclin D1 protein, and CSC-associated Hes1, Notch1, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins are enhanced during infection or ectopic expression of HCV core protein. IMPORTANCE Endoglin plays a crucial role in fibrogenesis and angiogenesis and is an important protein for tumor growth, survival, and cancer cell metastasis. Endoglin enhances ALK1-SMAD1/5 signaling in different cell types, leading to increased proliferation and migration responses. We have observed endoglin expression on the HCV core-expressing cell surface of human hepatocyte origin and activation of phosphoSMAD1/5 and ID1 downstream signaling molecules. ID1 protein plays a role in CSC properties, and we found that this pathway is importnt for antiapoptotic and cell proliferation signaling. Blocking of endoglin-ALK1-SMAD1/5 might be a good candidate for therapy for liver cancer stem cells together with liver cirrhosis.

TI HLA-B*14:02-Restricted Env-Specific CD8(+) T-Cell Activity Has Highly
   Potent Antiviral Efficacy Associated with Immune Control of HIV

AB Immune control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection is typically associated with effective Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. We here focus on HLA-B*14, that protects against HIV disease progression, but the immunodominant HLA-B*14-restricted anti-HIV response is Env-specific (ERYLKDQQL, HLA-B*14-EL9). A subdominant HLA-B*14-restricted response targets Gag (DRYFKTLRA, HLA-B*14-DA9). Using HLA-B*14/peptide-saporin conjugated tetramers, we show that HLA-B*14-EL9 is substantially more potent at inhibiting viral replication than HLA-B*14-DA9. HLA-B*14-EL9 also has significantly higher functional avidity (p<0.0001) and drives stronger selection pressure on the virus than HLA-B*14-DA9. However, these differences were HLA-B*14 subtype-specific, applying only to HLA-B*14:02 and not HLA-B*14:01. Furthermore, the HLA-B*14-associated protection against HIV disease progression is significantly greater for HLA-B*14:02 than for HLA-B*14:01, consistent with the superior antiviral efficacy of the HLA-B*14-EL9 response. Thus, although Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses may usually have greater anti-HIV efficacy, factors independent of protein specificity, including functional avidity of individual responses, are also critically important to immune control of HIV.
   IMPORTANCE In HIV infection, although CTL play a potentially critical role in eradication of viral reservoirs, the features that constitute an effective response remain poorly defined. We focus on HLA-B*14, unique among HLA associated with control of HIV in that the dominant CTL response is Env-specific, not Gag. We demonstrate that Env-specific HLA-B*14-restricted activity is substantially more efficacious than the subdominant HLA-B*14-restricted Gag response. Env immunodominance over Gag, and strong Env-mediated selection pressure on HIV, are only observed in subjects expressing HLA-B*14:02, and not HLA-B*14:01. This reflects increased functional avidity of Env response over Gag, substantially more marked for HLA-B*14:02. Finally, we show that HLA-B*14:02 is significantly more strongly associated with viraemic control than HLA-B*14:01. These findings indicate that, although Gag-specific CTL may usually have greater anti-HIV efficacy than Env responses, factors independent of protein specificity, including functional avidity, may carry greater weight in mediating effective control of HIV.

AB Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and recognize virus-infected cells as well as tumor cells. Conflicting data about the beneficial or even detrimental role of NK cells in different infectious diseases have been described previously. While the type of pathogen strongly influences NK cell functionality, less is known about how the infection dose influences the quality of a NK cell response against retroviruses. In this study, we used the well-established Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model to investigate the impact of virus dose on the induction of antiviral NK cell functions. High-dose virus inoculation increased initial virus replication compared to that with medium-or low-dose viral challenge and significantly improved NK cell activation. Antiviral NK cell activity, including in vivo cytotoxicity toward infected target cells, was also enhanced by high-dose virus infection. NK cell activation following high-dose viral challenge was likely mediated by activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages and the NK cell-stimulating cytokines interleukin 15 (IL-15) and IL-18. Neutralization of these cytokines decreased NK cell functions and increased viral loads, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity. Here we demonstrate that virus dose positively correlates with antiviral NK cell activity and function, which are at least partly driven by IL-15 and IL-18. Our results suggest that NK cell activity may be therapeutically enhanced by administering IL-15 and IL-18 in virus infections that inadequately activate NK cells.
   IMPORTANCE In infections with retroviruses, like HIV and FV infection of mice, NK cells clearly mediate antiviral activities, but they are usually not sufficient to prevent severe pathology. Here we show that the initial infection dose impacts the induction of an antiviral NK cell response during an acute retroviral infection, which had not investigated before. High-dose infection resulted in a strong NK cell functionality, whereas no antiviral activities were detected after low-or medium-dose infection. Interestingly, DCs and macrophages were highly activated after high-dose FV challenge, which corresponded with increased levels of NK cell-stimulating cytokines IL-15 and IL-18. IL-15 and IL-18 neutralization decreased NK cell functions, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity. Here we show the importance of cytokines for NK cell activation in retroviral infections; our findings suggest that immunotherapy combining the well-tolerated cytokines IL-15 and IL-18 might be an interesting approach for antiretroviral treatment.

AB Rational characterization of virulence and host-adaptive markers in the multifunctional influenza A virus NS1 protein is hindered by a lack of comprehensive knowledge about NS1-host protein protein interfaces. Here, we surveyed the impact of amino acid variation in NS1 at its structurally defined binding site for host p85 beta,a regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Structure-guided alanine scanning of all viral residues at this interface defined 10 positions contributing to the interaction, with residues 89, 95, 98, 133, 145, and 162 being the most important. A bioinformatic study of >24,000 publicly available NS1 sequences derived from viruses infecting different hosts highlighted several prevalent amino acid variants at the p85 beta interface that either enhanced (I95) or weakened (N135, T145, L161, Y161, S164) p85 beta binding. Interestingly, analysis of viruses circulating in humans since the 1918 pandemic revealed the temporal acquisition of functionally relevant variants at this interface. I95 (which enhanced p85 beta binding) quickly became prevalent in the 1940s and experimentally conferred a fitness advantage to a recombinant 1930s-based H1N1 virus in human lung epithelial cells. Surprisingly, H1N1 and H3N2 viruses recently acquired T145 or N135, respectively, which diminished p85 beta binding but apparently not the overall fitness in the human population. Evolutionary analyses revealed covariation of the NS1-p85 beta binding phenotype in humans with functional changes at multiple residues in other viral proteins, suggesting an unexplored compensatory or synergistic interplay between phenotypes in vivo. Overall, our data provide a resource to understand the consequences of the NS1-p85 beta binding spectrum of different influenza viruses and highlight the dynamic evolution of this property in viruses circulating in humans.
   IMPORTANCE In humans, influenza A viruses are responsible for causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. These viruses also circulate and evolve in other animal species, creating a reservoir from which novel viruses with distinct properties can emerge. The viral nonstructural protein NS1 is an important host range determinant and virulence factor that exhibits strain-specific interactions with several host factors, although few have been characterized extensively. In the study described here, we comprehensively surveyed the impact of natural and unnatural NS1 variations on the binding of NS1 to host p85 beta, a subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase that regulates intracellular metabolism and contributes to virus replication and virulence. We define the p85 beta-binding site on NS1 and provide a predictive resource to assess this ability of NS1 in viruses from different hosts. Strikingly, we uncover a spectrum of p85 beta binding by different NS1 proteins and reveal that viruses evolving in humans have undergone dynamic changes in this NS1 function over the last century.

AB Bivalent histone modifications are defined as repressive and activating epigenetic marks that simultaneously decorate the same genomic region. The H3K27me3 mark silences gene expression, while the H3K4me3 mark prevents the region from becoming permanently silenced and prepares the domain for activation when needed. Specific regions of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent episomes are poised to be activated by the KSHV replication and transcription activator (K-Rta). How KSHV episomes are prepared such that they maintain latent infection and switch to lytic replication by K-Rta remains unclear. K-Rta transactivation activity requires a protein degradation function; thus, we hypothesized that identification of cellular substrates of K-Rta may provide insight into the maintenance of KSHV latent infection and the switch to lytic replication. Here we show that a zinc finger protein, ZIC2, a key regulator for central nervous system development, is a substrate of K-Rta and is responsible for maintaining latency. K-Rta directly interacted with ZIC2 and functioned as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate ZIC2. ZIC2 localized at immediate early and early gene cluster regions of the KSHV genome and contributed to tethering of polycomb repressive complex 2 through physical interaction, thus maintaining H3K27me3 marks at the K-Rta promoter. Accordingly, depletion of ZIC2 shifted the balance of bivalent histone modifications toward more active forms and induced KSHV reactivation in naturally infected cells. We suggest that ZIC2 turnover by K-Rta is a strategy employed by KSHV to favor the transition from latency to lytic replication.
   IMPORTANCE Posttranslational histone modifications regulate the accessibility of transcriptional factors to DNA; thus, they have profound effects on gene expression (e.g., viral reactivation). KSHV episomes are known to possess bivalent chromatin domains. How such KSHV chromatin domains are maintained to be reactivatable by K-Rta remains unclear. We found that ZIC2, a transcriptional factor essential for stem cell pluripotency, plays a role in maintaining KSHV latent infection in naturally infected cells. We found that ZIC2 degradation by K-Rta shifts bivalent histone marks to a more active configuration, leading to KSHV reactivation. ZIC2 interacts with and maintains polycomb repressor complex 2 at the K-Rta promoter. Our findings uncover (i) a mechanism utilized by KSHV to maintain latent infection, (ii) a latency-lytic cycle switch operated by K-Rta, and (iii) a molecular mechanism of ZIC2-mediated local histone modification.

AB Exposure to dengue virus (DENV) is thought to elicit lifelong immunity, mediated by DENV-neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). However, Abs generated by primary infections confer serotype-specific protection, and immunity against other serotypes develops only after subsequent infections. Accordingly, the induction of these nAb responses acquired after serial DENV infections has been a long-sought-after goal for vaccination. Nonetheless, it is still unclear if tetravalent vaccines can elicit or recall nAbs. In this study, we have characterized the responses from a volunteer who had been previously exposed to DENV and was immunized with the live attenuated tetravalent vaccine Butantan-DV, developed by the NIH and Butantan Institute. Eleven days after vaccination, we observed an similar to 70-fold expansion of the plasmablast population. We generated 21 monoclonal Abs (MAbs) from singly sorted plasmablasts. These MAbs were the result of clonal expansions and had significant levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM). Nineteen MAbs (90.5%) neutralized at least one DENV serotype at concentrations of 1 mu g/ml or less; 6 of the 21 MAbs neutralized three or more serotypes. Despite the tetravalent composition of the vaccine, we observed a neutralization bias in the induced repertoire: DENV3 was targeted by 18 of the 19 neutralizing MAbs (nMAbs). Furthermore, the P3D05 nMAb neutralized DENV3 with extraordinary potency (concentration to achieve half-maximal neutralization [Neut(50)] = 0.03 mu g/ml). Thus, the Butantan-DV vaccine engendered a mature, antigen-selected B cell repertoire. Our results suggest that preexisting responses elicited by a previous DENV3 infection were recalled by immunization.
   IMPORTANCE The dengue epidemic presents a global public health challenge that causes widespread economic burden and remains largely unchecked by existing control strategies. Successful control of the dengue epidemic will require effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Several vaccine clinical efficacy trials are approaching completion, and the chances that one or more live attenuated tetravalent vaccines (LATVs) will be introduced worldwide is higher than ever. While it is widely accepted that dengue virus (DENV)-neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are associated with protection, the Ab repertoire induced by LATVs remain uncharacterized. Here, we describe the isolation of potent (Neut(50) < 0.1 mu g/ml) nAbs from a DENV-seropositive volunteer immunized with the tetravalent vaccine Butantan-DV, which is currently in phase III trials.

AB The innate immune system protects cells against viral pathogens in part through the autocrine and paracrine actions of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) (type I), IFN-gamma (type II), and IFN-lambda (type III). The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has a demonstrated role in shaping innate and adaptive antiviral immunity by inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and mediating signals downstream of IFN-gamma. Although ectopic expression experiments have suggested an inhibitory function of IRF-1 against infection of alphaviruses in cell culture, its role in vivo remains unknown. Here, we infected Irf1(-/-) mice with two distantly related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and assessed the early antiviral functions of IRF-1 prior to induction of adaptive B and T cell responses. IRF-1 expression limited CHIKV-induced foot swelling in joint-associated tissues and prevented dissemination of CHIKV and RRV at early time points. Virological and histological analyses revealed greater infection of muscle tissues in Irf1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 appeared to be independent of the induction of type I IFN or the effects of type II and III IFNs but were associated with altered local proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and differential infiltration of myeloid cell subsets. Collectively, our in vivo experiments suggest that IRF-1 restricts CHIKV and RRV infection in stromal cells, especially muscle cells, and that this controls local inflammation and joint-associated swelling.
   IMPORTANCE Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a broad range of antiviral host defense genes. In this study, using Irf1(-/-) mice, we investigated the role of IRF-1 in modulating pathogenesis of two related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus and Ross River virus. Our studies show that IRF-1 controlled alphavirus replication and swelling in jointassociated tissues within days of infection. Detailed histopathological and virological analyses revealed that IRF-1 preferentially restricted CHIKV infection in cells of non-hematopoietic lineage, including muscle cells. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 resulted in decreased local inflammatory responses in joint-associated tissues, which prevented immunopathology.

AB Immediate early proteins of human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) are expressed at the outset of lytic infection and thereby regulate viral gene expression. Immediate early protein 2 (IE2) of HHV-6A is a transactivator that drives a variety of promoters. The C-terminal region of HHV-6A IE2 is shared among IE2 homologs in betaherpesviruses and is involved in dimerization, DNA binding, and transcription factor binding. In this study, the structure of the IE2 C-terminal domain (IE2-CTD) was determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.5 angstrom. IE2-CTD forms a homodimer stabilized by a beta-barrel core with two interchanging long loops. Unexpectedly, the core structure resembles those of the gammaherpesvirus factors EBNA1 of Epstein-Barr virus and LANA of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, but the interchanging loops are longer in IE2-CTD and form helix-turn-helix (HTH)-like motifs at their tips. The HTH and surrounding alpha-helicesform a structural feature specific to the IE2 group. The apparent DNA-binding site (based on structural similarity with EBNA1 and LANA) resides on the opposite side of the HTH-like motifs, surrounded by positive electrostatic potential. Mapping analysis of conserved residues on the three-dimensional structure delineated a potential factor-binding site adjacent to the expected DNA-binding site. The predicted bi-or tripartite functional sites indicate a role for IE2-CTD as an adapter connecting the promoter and transcriptional factors that drive gene expression.
   IMPORTANCE Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and HHV-6B belong to betaherpesvirus subfamily. Both viruses establish lifelong latency after primary infection, and their reactivation poses a significant risk to immunocompromised patients. Immediate early protein 2 (IE2) of HHV-6A and HHV-6B is a transactivator that triggers viral replication and contains a DNA-binding domain shared with other betaherpesviruses such as human herpesvirus 7 and human cytomegalovirus. In this study, an atomic structure of the DNA-binding domain of HHV-6A IE2 was determined and analyzed, enabling a structure-based understanding of the functions of IE2, specifically DNA recognition and interaction with transcription factors. Unexpectedly, the dimeric core resembles the DNA-binding domain of transcription regulators from gammaherpesviruses, showing structural conservation as a DNA-binding domain but with its own unique structural features. These findings facilitate further characterization of this key viral transactivator.

TI The K186E Amino Acid Substitution in the Canine Influenza Virus H3N8 NS1
   Protein Restores Its Ability To Inhibit Host Gene Expression

AB Canine influenza viruses (CIVs) are the causative agents of canine influenza, a contagious respiratory disease in dogs, and include the equine-origin H3N8 and the avian-origin H3N2 viruses. Influenza A virus (IAV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence factor essential for counteracting the innate immune response. Here, we evaluated the ability of H3N8 CIV NS1 to inhibit host innate immune responses. We found that H3N8 CIV NS1 was able to efficiently counteract interferon (IFN) responses but was unable to block general gene expression in human or canine cells. Such ability was restored by a single amino acid substitution in position 186 (K186E) that resulted in NS1 binding to the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), a cellular protein involved in pre-mRNA processing. We also examined the frequency distribution of K186 and E186 among H3N8 CIVs and equine influenza viruses (ElVs), the ancestors of H3N8 CIV, and experimentally determined the impact of amino acid 186 in the ability of different CIV and EIV NS1s to inhibit general gene expression. In all cases, the presence of E186 was responsible for the control of host gene expression. In contrast, the NS1 protein of H3N2 CIV harbors E186 and blocks general gene expression in canine cells. Altogether, our results confirm previous studies on the strain-dependent ability of NS1 to block general gene expression. Moreover, the observed polymorphism on amino acid 186 between H3N8 and H3N2 CIVs might be the result of adaptive changes acquired during long-term circulation of avian-origin lAVs in mammals.
   IMPORTANCE Canine influenza is a respiratory disease of dogs caused by two CIV subtypes, the H3N8 and H3N2 viruses, of equine and avian origins, respectively. Influenza NS1 is the main viral factor responsible for the control of host innate immune responses, and changes in NS1 can play an important role in host adaptation. Here we assessed the ability of H3N8 CIV NS1 to inhibit host innate immune responses and gene expression. The H3N8 CIV NS1 did not block host gene expression, but this activity was restored by a single amino acid substitution (K186E), which was responsible for NS1 binding to the host factor CPSF30. In contrast, the H3N2 CIV NS1, which contains E186, blocks general gene expression. Our results suggest that the ability to block host gene expression is not required for influenza virus replication in mammals but might be important in the long-term adaptation of avian-origin influenza viruses to mammals.

AB The HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) is a 351-base element in un-spliced and partially spliced viral RNA; binding of the RRE by the viral Rev protein induces nuclear export of RRE-containing RNAs, as required for virus replication. It contains one long, imperfect double helix (domain I), one branched domain (domain II) containing a high-affinity Rev-binding site, and two or three additional domains. We previously reported that the RRE assumes an "A" shape in solution and suggested that the location of the Rev binding sites in domains I and II, opposite each other on the two legs of the A, is optimal for Rev binding and explains Rev's specificity for RRE-containing RNAs. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and a quantitative functional assay, we have now analyzed a panel of RRE mutants. All the results support the essential role of the A shape for RRE function. Moreover, they suggest that the distal portion of domain I and the three crowning domains all contribute to the maintenance of the A shape. Domains I and II are necessary and sufficient for substantial RRE function, provided they are joined by a flexible linker that allows the two domains to face each other.
   IMPORTANCE Retroviral replication requires that some of the viral RNAs transcribed in the cell nucleus be exported to the cytoplasm without being spliced. To achieve this, HIV-1 encodes a protein, Rev, which binds to a complex, highly structured element within viral RNA, the Rev response element (RRE), and escorts RRE-containing RNAs from the nucleus. We previously reported that the RRE is "A" shaped and suggested that this architecture, with the 2 legs opposite one another, can explain the specificity of Rev for the RRE. We have analyzed the functional contributions of individual RRE domains and now report that several domains contribute, with some redundancy, to maintenance of the overall RRE shape. The data strongly support the hypothesis that the opposed placement of the 2 legs is essential for RRE function.

AB Viruses display a wide range of genomic profiles and, consequently, a variety of gene expression strategies. Specific sequences associated with transcriptional processes have been described in viruses, and putative promoter motifs have been elucidated for some nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). Among NCLDV, the Marseilleviridae is a well-recognized family because of its genomic mosaicism. The marseilleviruses have an ability to incorporate foreign genes, especially from sympatric organisms inhabiting Acanthamoeba, its main known host. Here, we identified for the first time an eight-nucleotide A/T-rich promoter sequence (AAATATTT) associated with 55% of marseillevirus genes that is conserved in all marseilleviruses lineages, a higher level of conservation than that of any giant virus described to date. We instigated our prediction about the promoter motif by biological assays and by evaluating how single mutations in this octamer can impact gene expression. The investigation of sequences that regulate the expression of genes relative to lateral transfer revealed that the promoter motifs do not appear to be incorporated by marseilleviruses from donor organisms. Indeed, analyses of the intergenic regions that regulate lateral gene transfer-related genes have revealed an independent origin of the marseillevirus intergenic regions that does not match gene-donor organisms. About 50% of AAATATTT motifs spread throughout intergenic regions of the marseilleviruses are present as multiple copies. We believe that such multiple motifs are associated with increased expression of a given gene or are related to incorporation of foreign genes into the mosaic genome of marseilleviruses.
   IMPORTANCE The marseilleviruses draw attention because of the peculiar features of their genomes; however, little is known about their gene expression patterns or the factors that regulate those expression patterns. The limited published research on the expression patterns of the marseilleviruses and their unique genomes has led us to study the promoter motif sequences in the intergenic regions of the marseilleviruses. This work is the first to analyze promoter sequences in the genomes of the marseilleviruses. We also suggest a strong capacity to acquire foreign genes and to express those genes mediated by multiple copies of the promoter motifs available in intergenic regions. These findings contribute to an understanding of genomic expansion and plasticity observed in these giant viruses.

TI Effect of Polymorphisms at Codon 146 of the Goat PRNP Gene on
   Susceptibility to Challenge with Classical Scrapie by Different Routes

AB This report presents the results of experimental challenges of goats with scrapie by both the intracerebral (i.c.) and oral routes, exploring the effects of polymorphisms at codon 146 of the goat PRNP gene on resistance to disease. The results of these studies illustrate that while goats of all genotypes can be infected by i.c. challenge, the survival distribution of the animals homozygous for asparagine at codon 146 was significantly shorter than those of animals of all other genotypes (chi-square value, 10.8; P = 0.001). In contrast, only those animals homozygous for asparagine at codon 146 (NN animals) succumbed to oral challenge. The results also indicate that any cases of infection in non-NN animals can be detected by the current confirmatory test (immunohistochemistry), although successful detection with the rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was more variable and dependent on the polymorphism. Together with data from previous studies of goats exposed to infection in the field, these data support the previously reported observations that polymorphisms at this codon have a profound effect on susceptibility to disease. It is concluded that only animals homozygous for asparagine at codon 146 succumb to scrapie under natural conditions.
   IMPORTANCE In goats, like in sheep, there are PRNP polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility or resistance to scrapie. However, in contrast to the polymorphisms in sheep, they are more numerous in goats and may be restricted to certain breeds or geographical regions. Therefore, eradication programs must be specifically designed depending on the identification of suitable polymorphisms. An initial analysis of surveillance data suggested that such a polymorphism in Cypriot goats may lie in codon 146. In this study, we demonstrate experimentally that NN animals are highly susceptible after i.c. inoculation. The presence of a D or S residue prolonged incubation periods significantly, and prions were detected in peripheral tissues only in NN animals. In oral challenges, prions were detected only in NN animals, and the presence of a D or S residue at this position conferred resistance to the disease. This study provides an experimental transmission model for assessing the genetic susceptibility of goats to scrapie.

AB Retrovirus-derived virus-like particles ( VLPs) are particularly interesting vaccine platforms, as they trigger efficient humoral and cellular immune responses and can be used to display heterologous antigens. In this study, we characterized the intrinsic immunogenicity of VLPs and investigated their possible adjuvantization by incorporation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. We designed a noncoding singlestranded RNA (ncRNA) that could be encapsidated by VLPs and induce TLR7/ 8 signaling. We found that VLPs efficiently induce in vitro dendritic cell activation, which can be improved by ncRNA encapsidation (ncRNAVLPs). Transcriptome studies of dendritic cells harvested from the spleens of immunized mice identified antigen presentation and immune activation as the main gene expression signatures induced by VLPs, while TLR signaling and Th1 signatures characterize ncRNAVLPs. In vivo and compared with standard VLPs, ncRNAVLPs promoted Th1 responses and improved CD8(+) T cell proliferation in a MyD88-dependent manner. In an HIV vaccine mouse model, HIV-pseudotyped ncRNAVLPs elicited stronger antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses than VLPs. Altogether, our findings provide molecular evidence for a strong vaccine potential of retrovirus-derived VLPs that can be further improved by harnessing TLR-mediated immune activation.
   IMPORTANCE We previously reported that DNA vaccines encoding antigens displayed in/ on retroviral VLPs are more efficient than standard DNA vaccines at inducing cellular and humoral immune responses. We aimed to decipher the mechanisms and investigated the VLPs' immunogenicity independently of DNA vaccination. We show that VLPs have the ability to activate antigen-presenting cells directly, thus confirming their intrinsic immunostimulatory properties and their potential to be used as an antigenic platform. Notably, this immunogenicity can be further improved and/or oriented by the incorporation into VLPs of ncRNA, which provides further TLR-mediated activation and Th1-type CD4(+) and CD8+ T cell response orientation. Our results highlight the versatility of retrovirus-derived VLP design and the value of using ncRNA as an intrinsic vaccine adjuvant.

AB The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) afflicts livestock in more than 80 countries, limiting food production and global trade. Production of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines requires cytosolic expression of the FMDV 3C protease to cleave the P1 polyprotein into mature capsid proteins, but the FMDV 3C protease is toxic to host cells. To identify less-toxic isoforms of the FMDV 3C protease, we screened 3C mutants for increased transgene output in comparison to wild-type 3C using a Gaussia luciferase reporter system. The novel point mutation 3C(L127P) increased yields of recombinant FMDV subunit proteins in mammalian and bacterial cells expressing P1-3C transgenes and retained the ability to process P1 polyproteins from multiple FMDV serotypes. The 3C(L127P) mutant produced crystalline arrays of FMDV-like particles in mammalian and bacterial cells, potentially providing a practical method of rapid, inexpensive FMD vaccine production in bacteria.
   IMPORTANCE The mutant FMDV 3C protease L127P significantly increased yields of recombinant FMDV subunit antigens and produced virus-like particles in mammalian and bacterial cells. The L127P mutation represents a novel advancement for economical FMD vaccine production.

AB Neurotropism is a defining characteristic of alphaherpesvirus pathogenicity. Glycoprotein K (gK) is a conserved virion glycoprotein of all alphaherpesviruses that is not found in other herpesvirus subfamilies. The extracellular amino terminus of gK has been shown to be important to the ability of the prototypic alphaherpesvirus herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to enter neurons via axonal termini. Here, we determined the role of the two conserved N-linked glycosylation (N48 and N58) sites of gK in virus-induced cell fusion and replication. We found that N-linked glycosylation is important to the regulation of HSV-1-induced membrane fusion since mutating N58 to alanine (N58A) caused extensive virus-induced cell fusion. Due to the known contributions of N-linked glycosylation to protein processing and correct disulfide bond formation, we investigated whether the conserved extracellular cysteine residues within the amino terminus of gK contributed to the regulation of HSV-1-induced membrane fusion. We found that mutation of C37 and C114 residues led to a gK-null phenotype characterized by very small plaque formation and drastic reduction in infectious virus production, while mutation of C82 and C243 caused extensive virus-induced cell fusion. Comparison of N-linked glycosylation and cysteine mutant replication kinetics identified disparate effects on infectious virion egress from infected cells. Specifically, cysteine mutations caused defects in the accumulation of infectious virus in both the cellular and supernatant fractions, while glycosylation site mutants did not adversely affect virion egress from infected cells. These results demonstrate a critical role for the N glycosylation sites and cysteines for the structure and function of the amino terminus of gK.
   IMPORTANCE We have previously identified important entry and neurotropic determinants in the amino terminus of HSV-1 glycoprotein K (gK). Alphaherpesvirus-mediated membrane fusion is a complex and highly regulated process that is not clearly understood. gK and UL20, which are highly conserved across all alphaherpesviruses, play important roles in the regulation of HSV-1 fusion in the context of infection. A greater understanding of mechanisms governing alphaherpesvirus membrane fusion is expected to inform the rational design of therapeutic and prevention strategies to combat herpesviral infection and pathogenesis. This work adds to the growing reports regarding the importance of gK to alphaherpesvirus pathogenesis and details important structural features of gK that are involved in gK-mediated regulation of virus-induced membrane fusion.

AB Hantaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that cause severe hemorrhagic fever and pulmonary syndrome. The outer membrane of the hantavirus envelope displays a lattice of two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which orchestrate host cell recognition and entry. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the Gn glycoprotein ectodomain from the Asiatic Hantaan virus (HTNV), the most prevalent pathogenic hantavirus. Structural overlay analysis reveals that the HTNV Gn fold is highly similar to the Gn of Puumala virus (PUUV), a genetically and geographically distinct and less pathogenic hantavirus found predominantly in northeastern Europe, confirming that the hantaviral Gn fold is architecturally conserved across hantavirus clades. Interestingly, HTNV Gn crystallized at acidic pH, in a compact tetrameric configuration distinct from the organization at neutral pH. Analysis of the Gn, both in solution and in the context of the virion, confirms the pH-sensitive oligomeric nature of the glycoprotein, indicating that the hantaviral Gn undergoes structural transitions during host cell entry. These data allow us to present a structural model for how acidification during endocytic uptake of the virus triggers the dissociation of the metastable Gn-Gc lattice to enable insertion of the Gc-resident hydrophobic fusion loops into the host cell membrane. Together, these data reveal the dynamic plasticity of the structurally conserved hantaviral surface.
   IMPORTANCE Although outbreaks of Korean hemorrhagic fever were first recognized during the Korean War (1950 to 1953), it was not until 1978 that they were found to be caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), the most prevalent pathogenic hantavirus. Here, we describe the crystal structure of HTNV envelope glycoprotein Gn, an integral component of the Gn-Gc glycoprotein spike complex responsible for host cell entry. HTNV Gn is structurally conserved with the Gn of a genetically and geographically distal hantavirus, Puumala virus, indicating that the observed alpha/beta fold is well preserved across the Hantaviridae family. The combination of our crystal structure with solution state analysis of recombinant protein and electron cryo-microscopy of acidified hantavirus allows us to propose a model for endosome-induced reorganization of the hantaviral glycoprotein lattice. This provides a molecular-level rationale for the exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loops on the Gc, a process required for fusion of viral and cellular membranes.

TI Cooperation of the Ebola Virus Proteins VP40 and GP(1,2) with BST2 To
   Activate NF-kappa B Independently of Virus-Like Particle Trapping

AB BST2 is a host protein with dual functions in response to viral infections: it traps newly assembled enveloped virions at the plasma membrane in infected cells, and it induces NF-kappa B activity, especially in the context of retroviral assembly. In this study, we examined whether Ebola virus proteins affect BST2-mediated induction of NF-kappa B. We found that the Ebola virus matrix protein. VP40, and envelope glycoprotein, GP, each cooperate with BST2 to induce NF-kappa B activity, with maximal activity when all three proteins are expressed. Unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein, which antagonizes both virion entrapment and the activation of NF-kappa B by BST2. Ebola virus GP does not inhibit NF-kappa B signaling even while it antagonizes the entrapment of virus-like particles. GP from Reston ebolavirus, a nonpathogenic species in humans, showed a phenotype similar to that of GP from Zaire ebolavirus, a highly pathogenic species, in terms of both the activation of NF-kappa B and the antagonism of virion entrapment. Although Ebola virus VP40 and GP both activate NF-kappa B independently of BST2, VP40 is the more potent activator. Activation of NF-kappa B by the Ebola virus proteins either alone or together with BST2 requires the canonical NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Mechanistically, the maximal NF-kappa B activation by GP. VP40, and BST2 together requires the ectodomain cysteines needed for BST2 dimerization, the putative BST2 tetramerization residue L70, and Y6 of a potential hemi-ITAM motif in BST2's cytoplasmic domain. BST2 with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal deletion, which is not expressed at the plasma membrane and is unable to entrap virions, activated NF-kappa B in concert with the Ebola virus proteins at least as effectively as wild-type BST2. Signaling by the GPI anchor mutant also depended on Y6 of BST2. Overall, our data show that activation of NF-kappa B by BST2 is independent of virion entrapment in the case of Ebola virus. Nonetheless. BST2 may induce or amplify proinflammatory signaling during Ebola virus infection, potentially contributing to the dysregulated cytokine response that is a hallmark of Ebola virus disease.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding how the host responds to viral infections informs the development of therapeutics and vaccines. We asked how proinflammatory signaling by the host protein BST2/tetherin, which is mediated by the transcription factor NF-kappa B, responds to Ebola virus proteins. Although the Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) antagonizes the trapping of newly formed virions at the plasma membrane by BST2, we found that it does not inhibit BST2's ability to induce NF-kappa B activity. This distinguishes GP(1,2) from the HIV-1 protein Vpu, the prototype BST2 antagonist, which inhibits both virion entrapment and the induction of NF-kappa B activity. Ebola virus the Ebola virus matrix protein VP40, and BST2 are at least additive with respect to the induction of NF-kappa B activity. The effects of these proteins converge on an intracellular signaling pathway that depends on a protein modification termed neddylation. Better mechanistic understanding of these phenomena could provide targets for therapies that modulate the inflammatory response during Ebola virus disease.

AB Newly assembled herpesvirus nucleocapsids are translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol by a vesicle-mediated process engaging the nuclear membranes. This transport is governed by the conserved nuclear egress complex (NEC), consisting of the alphaherpesviral pUL34 and pUL31 homologs. The NEC is not only required for efficient nuclear egress but also sufficient for vesicle formation from the inner nuclear membrane (INM), as well as from synthetic lipid bilayers. The recently solved crystal structures for the NECs from different herpes viruses revealed molecular details of this membrane deformation and scission machinery uncovering the interfaces involved in complex and coat formation. However, the interaction domain with the nucleocapsid remained undefined. Since the NEC assembles a curved hexagonal coat on the nucleoplasmic side of the INM consisting of tightly interwoven pUL31/pUL34 heterodimers arranged in hexamers, only the membrane-distal end of the NEC formed by pUL31 residues appears to be accessible for interaction with the nucleocapsid cargo. To identify the amino acids involved in capsid incorporation, we mutated the corresponding regions in the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV). Site-specifically mutated pUL31 homologs were tested for localization, interaction with pUL34, and complementation of PrV-Delta UL31. We identified a conserved lysine residue at amino acid position 242 in PrV pUL31 located in the alpha-helical domain H10 exposed on the membrane -distal end of the NEC as a key residue for nucleocapsid incorporation into the nascent primary particle.
   IMPORTANCE Vesicular transport through the nuclear envelope is a focus of research but is still not well understood. Herpesviruses pioneered this mechanism for translocation of the newly assembled nucleocapsid from the nucleus into the cytosol via vesicles derived from the inner nuclear membrane which fuse in a well-tuned process with the outer nuclear membrane to release their content. The structure of the viral nuclear membrane budding and scission machinery has been solved recently, providing in-depth molecular details. However, how cargo is incorporated remained unclear. We identified a conserved lysine residue in the membrane-distal portion of the nuclear egress complex required for capsid uptake into inner nuclear membrane-derived vesicles.

TI The UL21 Tegument Protein of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Is Differentially

AB The initial goal of this study was to reexamine the requirement of UL21 for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication. Previous studies suggested that UL21 is dispensable for replication in cell cultures, but a recent report on HSV-2 challenges those findings. As was done for the HSV-2 study, a UL21-null virus was made and propagated on complementing cells to discourage selection of compensating mutations. This HSV-1 mutant was able to replicate in noncomplementing cells, even at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), though a reduction in titer was observed. Also, increased proportions of empty capsids were observed in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role for UL21 in preventing their exit from the nucleus. Surprisingly, passage of the null mutant resulted in rapid outgrowth of syncytial (Syn) variants. This was unexpected because UL21 has been shown to be required for the Syn phenotype. However, earlier experiments made use of only the A855V syncytial mutant of glycoprotein B (gB), and the Syn phenotype can also be produced by substitutions in glycoprotein K (gK), UL20, and UL24. Sequencing of the syncytial variants revealed mutations in the gK locus, but UL21 was shown to be dispensable for UL20Syn and UL24Syn. To test whether UL21 is needed only for the A855V mutant, additional gBSyn derivatives were examined in the context of the null virus, and all produced lytic rather than syncytial sites of infection. Thus, UL21 is required only for the gBSyn phenotype. This is the first example of a differential requirement for a viral protein across the four syn loci.
   IMPORTANCE UL21 is conserved among alphaherpesviruses, but its role is poorly understood. This study shows that HSV-1 can replicate without UL21, although the virus titers are greatly reduced. The null virus had greater proportions of empty (DNA-less) capsids in the cytoplasm of infected cells, suggesting that UL21 may play a role in retaining them in the nucleus. This is consistent with reports showing UL21 to be capsid associated and localized to the nuclei of infected cells. UL21 also appears to be needed for viral membrane activities. It was found to be required for virus-mediated cell fusion, but only for mutants that harbor syncytial mutations in gB (not variants of gK, UL20, or UL24). The machinery needed for syncytial formation is similar to that needed for direct spread of the virus through cell junctions, and these studies show that UL21 is required for cell-to-cell spread even in the absence of syncytial mutations.

AB The K15P membrane protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) interacts with multiple cellular signaling pathways and is thought to play key roles in KSHV-associated endothelial cell angiogenesis, regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and the survival, activation, and proliferation of BCR-negative primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. Although full-length K15P is similar to 45 kDa, numerous lower-molecular-weight forms of the protein exist as a result of differential splicing and poorly characterized posttranslational processing. K15P has been reported to localize to numerous subcellular organelles in heterologous expression studies, but there are limited data concerning the sorting of K15P in KSHV-infected cells. The relationships between the various molecular weight forms of K15P, their subcellular distribution, and how these may differ in latent and lytic KSHV infections are poorly understood. Here we report that a cDNA encoding a full-length, similar to 45-kDa K15P reporter protein is expressed as an similar to 23- to 24-kDa species that colocalizes with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker TGN46 in KSHV-infected PEL cells. Following lytic reactivation by sodium butyrate, the levels of the similar to 23- to 24-kDa protein diminish, and the full-length, similar to 45-kDa K15P protein accumulates. This is accompanied by apparent fragmentation of the TGN and redistribution of K15P to a dispersed peripheral location. Similar results were seen when lytic reactivation was stimulated by the KSHV protein replication and transcription activator (RTA) and during spontaneous reactivation. We speculate that expression of different molecular weight forms of K15P in distinct cellular locations reflects the alternative demands placed upon the protein in the latent and lytic phases.
   IMPORTANCE The K15P protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is thought to play key roles in disease, including KSHV-associated angiogenesis and the survival and growth of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. The protein exists in multiple molecular weight forms, and its intracellular trafficking is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the molecular weight form of a reporter K15P molecule and its intracellular distribution change when KSHV switches from its latent (quiescent) phase to the lytic, infectious state. We speculate that expression of different molecular weight forms of K15P in distinct cellular locations reflects the alternative demands placed upon the protein in the viral latent and lytic stages.

AB Henipaviruses, such as Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, are highly pathogenic zoonotic agents within the Paramyxoviridae family. The phosphoprotein (P) gene products of the paramyxoviruses have been well characterized for their interferon (IFN) antagonist activity and their contribution to viral pathogenicity. In this study, we demonstrated that the nucleoprotein (N) of henipaviruses also prevents the host IFN signaling response. Reporter assays demonstrated that the NiV and HeV N proteins (NiV-N and HeV-N, respectively) dose-dependently suppressed both type I and type II IFN responses and that the inhibitory effect was mediated by their core domains. Additionally, NiV-N prevented the nuclear transport of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. However, NiV-N did not associate with Imp alpha 5, Imp beta 1, or Ran, which are members of the nuclear transport system for STATs. Although P protein is known as a binding partner of N protein and actively retains N protein in the cytoplasm, the IFN antagonist activity of N protein was not abolished by the coexpression of P protein. This suggests that the IFN inhibition by N protein occurs in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the complex formation of STATs was hampered in the N protein-expressing cells. As a result, STAT nuclear accumulation was reduced, causing a subsequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) due to low promoter occupancy by STAT complexes. This novel route for preventing host IFN responses by henipavirus N proteins provides new insight into the pathogenesis of these viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Paramyxoviruses are well known for suppressing interferon (IFN)mediated innate immunity with their phosphoprotein (P) gene products, and the henipaviruses also possess P, V, W, and C proteins for evading host antiviral responses. There are numerous studies providing evidence for the relationship between viral pathogenicity and antagonistic activities against IFN responses by P gene products. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to the influence of nucleoprotein (N) on host innate immune responses. In this study, we demonstrated that both the NiV and HeV N proteins have antagonistic activity against the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by preventing the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of STAT1 and STAT2. This inhibitory effect is due to an impairment of the ability of STATs to form complexes. These results provide new insight into the involvement of N protein in viral pathogenicity via its IFN antagonism.

AB Soluble envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers (SOSIP.664 gp140) are attractive HIV-1 vaccine candidates, with structures that mimic the native membrane bound Env spike (gp160). Since engineering trimers can be limited by the difficulty of rationally predicting beneficial mutations, here we used a more comprehensive mutagenesis approach with the goal of identifying trimer variants with improved antigenic and stability properties. We created 341 cysteine pairs at predicted points of stabilization throughout gp140, 149 proline residue substitutions at every residue of the gp41 ectodomain, and 362 space-filling residue substitutions at every hydrophobic and aromatic residue in gp140. The parental protein target, the Glade B strain B41 SOSIP.664 gp140, does not bind the broadly neutralizing antibody PGT151 and so was used here to identify improved variants that also provide insight into the structural basis for Env antigenicity. Each of the 852 mutants was expressed in human cells and screened for antigenicity using four different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), including PGT151. We identified 29 trimer variants with antigenic improvements derived from each of the three mutagenesis strategies. We selected four variants (Q203F, T538F, 1548F, and M629P) for more comprehensive biochemical, structural, and antigenicity analyses. The T538F substitution had the most beneficial effect overall, including restoration of the PGT151 epitope. The improved B41 SOSIP.664 trimer variants identified here may be useful for vaccine and structural studies.
   IMPORTANCE Soluble Env trimers have become attractive HIV-1 vaccine candidates, but the prototype designs are capable of further improvement through protein engineering. Using a high-throughput screening technology (shotgun mutagenesis) to create and evaluate 852 variants, we were able to identify sequence changes that were beneficial to the antigenicity and stability of soluble trimers based on the Glade B B41 env gene. The strategies described here may be useful for identifying a wider range of antigenically and structurally improved soluble trimers based on multiple genotypes for use in programs intended to create a broadly protective HIV-1 vaccine.

AB Two subtypes of influenza A virus (IAV), avian-origin canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 (CIV-H3N2) and equine-origin CIV H3N8 (CIV-H3N8), are enzootic in the canine population. Dogs have been demonstrated to seroconvert in response to diverse IAVs, and naturally occurring reassortants of CIV-H3N2 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) have been isolated. We conducted a thorough phenotypic evaluation of CIV-H3N2 in order to assess its threat to human health. Using ferret-generated antiserum, we determined that CIV-H3N2 is antigenically distinct from contemporary human H3N2 IAVs, suggesting that there may be minimal herd immunity in humans. We assessed the public health risk of CIV-H3N2 x pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) reassortants by characterizing their in vitro genetic compatibility and in vivo pathogenicity and transmissibility. Using a luciferase minigenome assay, we quantified the polymerase activity of all possible 16 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP) between CIV-H3N2 and pdmH1N1, identifying some combinations that were more active than either parental virus complex. Using reverse genetics and fixing the CIV-H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA), we found that 51 of the 127 possible reassortant viruses were viable and able to be rescued. Nineteen of these reassortant viruses had high-growth phenotypes in vitro, and 13 of these replicated in mouse lungs. A single reassortant with the NP and HA gene segments from CIV-H3N2 was selected for characterization in ferrets. The reassortant was efficiently transmitted by contact but not by the airborne route and was pathogenic in ferrets. Our results suggest that CIV-H3N2 reassortants may pose a moderate risk to public health and that the canine host should be monitored for emerging IAVs.
   IMPORTANCE IAV pandemics are caused by the introduction of novel viruses that are capable of efficient and sustained transmission into a human population with limited herd immunity. Dogs are a a potential mixing vessel for avian and mammalian IAVs and represent a human health concern due to their susceptibility to infection, large global population, and close physical contact with humans. Our results suggest that humans are likely to have limited preexisting immunity to CIV-H3N2 and that CIV-H3N2 x pdmH1N1 reassortants have moderate genetic compatibility and are transmissible by direct contact in ferrets. Our study contributes to the increasing evidence that surveillance of the canine population for IAVs is an important component of pandemic preparedness.

AB Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates with a high case fatality rate. No approved drug or vaccine of EBOV is available, which necessitates better understanding of the virus life cycle. Studies on EBOV have been hampered because experimentations involving live virus are restricted to biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratories. The EBOV minigenome system has provided researchers with the opportunity to study EBOV under BSL2 conditions. Here, we developed a novel EBOV minigenome replicon which, to our knowledge, is the first EBOV cell culture system that can stably replicate and transcribe the EBOV minigenome. The minigenomic RNA harboring a Gaussia luciferase and hygromycin-resistant marker can replicate for months in a helper cell stably expressing viral nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), VP30, and L proteins. Quantification of viral RNA (vRNA), cRNA, and mRNA levels of the EBOV minigenome demonstrated that the stable EBOV replicon had much-more-active minigenome replication than previously developed transient-transfection-based EBOV minigenome systems, which recapitulate viral primary transcription more than genome replication. Interestingly, minigenome replication in the stable EBOV replicon cells was insensitive to interferon treatment or RNA interference. Moreover, RNase digestion of the replicon cell lysates revealed the remarkably stable nature of the EBOV minigenomic vRNA ribonucleoprotein complex, which may help improve understanding of EBOV persistence in convalescent patients.
   IMPORTANCE The scope and severity of the recent Ebola outbreak in Western Africa justified a more comprehensive investigation of the causative risk group 4 agent Ebola virus (EBOV). Study of EBOV replication and antiviral development can be facilitated by developing a cell culture system that allows experimentation under biosafety level 2 conditions. Here, we developed a novel stable EBOV minigenome replicon which, to our knowledge, is the first EBOV cell culture system that can stably replicate and transcribe the EBOV minigenome. The replicon system had more-active genome replication than previously developed transient-transfection-based EBOV minigenome systems, providing a convenient surrogate system to study EBOV replication. Furthermore, self-replicating minigenomic vRNA in the replicon cells displayed strong stability in response to interferon treatment, RNA silencing, and RNase digestion, which may provide an explanation for the persistence of EBOV in survivors.

   IDENTIFICATION; E7
AB The human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoproteins recruit the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP/UBE3A to target cellular substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation, and one consequence of this activity is the E6 stimulation of E6AP autoubiquitination and degradation. Recent studies identified an autism-linked mutation within E6AP at T485, which was identified as a protein kinase A phosphoacceptor site and which could directly regulate E6AP ubiquitin ligase activity. In this study, we have analyzed how T485-mediated regulation of E6AP might affect E6 targeting of some of its known substrates. We show that modulation of T485 has no effect on the ability of E6 to direct either p53 or Dlg for degradation. Furthermore, T485 regulation has no effect on HPV-16 or HPV-31 E6-induced autodegradation of E6AP but does affect HPV-18 E6-induced autodegradation of E6AP. In cells derived from cervical cancers, we find low levels of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated E6AP in the nucleus. However, ablation of E6 results in a dramatic accumulation of phospho-E6AP in the cytoplasm, whereas nonphosphorylated E6AP accumulates primarily in the nucleus. Interestingly, E6AP phosphorylation at T485 confers association with 14-3-3 proteins, and this interaction seems to be important, in part, for the ability of E6 to recruit phospho-E6AP into the nucleus. These results demonstrate that HPV E6 overrides the normal phosphoregulation of E6AP, both in terms of its enzymatic activity and its subcellular distribution.
   IMPORTANCE Recent reports demonstrate the importance of phosphoregulation of E6AP for its normal enzymatic activity. Here, we show that HPV E6 is capable of overriding this regulation and can promote degradation of p53 and Dlg regardless of the phosphorylation status of E6AP. Furthermore, E6 interaction with E6AP also significantly alters how E6AP is subject to autodegradation and suggests that this is not a simple stimulation of an already-existing activity but rather a redirection of E6AP activity toward itself. Furthermore, E6-mediated regulation of the subcellular distribution of phospho-E6AP appears to be dependent, in part, upon the 14-3-3 family of proteins.

AB Oral mucosa is one of the main target tissues of the human pathogen herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). How the virus overcomes the protective epithelial barriers and penetrates the tissue to reach its receptors and initiate infection is still unclear. Here, we established an ex vivo infection assay with human oral mucosa that allows viral entry studies in a natural target tissue. The focus was on the susceptibility of keratinocytes in the epithelium and the characterization of cellular receptors that mediate viral entry. Upon ex vivo infection of gingiva or vestibular mucosa, we observed that intact human mucosa samples were protected from viral invasion. In contrast, the basal layer of the oral epithelium was efficiently invaded once the connective tissue and the basement membrane were removed. Later during infection, HSV-1 spread from basal keratinocytes to upper layers, demonstrating the susceptibility of the stratified squamous epithelium to HSV-1. The analysis of potential receptors revealed nectin-1 on most mucosal keratinocytes, whereas herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) was found only on a subpopulation of cells, suggesting that nectin-1 acts as primary receptor for HSV-1 in human oral mucosa. To mimic the supposed entry route of HSV-1 via microlesions in vivo, we mechanically wounded the mucosa prior to infection. While we observed a limited number of infected keratinocytes in some wounded mucosa samples, other samples showed no infected cells. Thus, we conclude that mechanical wounding of mucosa is insufficient for the virus to efficiently overcome epithelial barriers and to make entry-mediating receptors accessible.
   IMPORTANCE To invade the target tissue of its human host during primary infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) must overcome the epithelial barriers of mucosa, skin, or cornea. For most viruses, the mechanisms underlying the invasion into the target tissues of their host organism are still open. Here, we established an ex vivo infection model of human oral mucosa to explore how HSV can enter its target tissue. Our results demonstrate that intact mucosa samples and even compromised tissue allow only very limited access of HSV to keratinocytes. Detailed understanding of barrier functions is an essential precondition to unravel how HSV bypasses the barriers and approaches its receptors in tissue and why it is beneficial for the virus to use a cell-cell adhesion molecule, such as nectin-1, as a receptor.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. At this young age, infants typically depend on maternally transferred antibodies (matAbs) and their innate immune system for protection against infections. RSV-specific matAbs are thought to protect from severe illness, yet severe RSV disease occurs mainly below 6 months of age, when neutralizing matAb levels are present. To investigate this discrepancy, we asked if disease severity is related to antibody properties other than neutralization. Some antibody effector functions are mediated via their Fc binding region. However, it has been shown that this binding may lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection or reduction of neutralization, both possibly leading to more disease. In this study, we first showed that high levels of ADE of RSV infection occur in monocytic THP-1 cells in the presence of RSV antibodies and that neutralization by these antibodies was reduced in Vero cells when they were transduced with Fc gamma receptors. We then demonstrated that antibodies from cotton rats with formalin-inactivated (FI)RSV- induced pulmonary pathology were capable of causing ADE. Human matAbs also caused ADE and were less neutralizing in vitro in cells that carry Fc receptors. However, these effects were unrelated to disease severity because they were seen both in uninfected controls and in infants hospitalized with different levels of RSV disease severity. We conclude that ADE and reduction of neutralization are unlikely to be involved in RSV disease in infants with neutralizing matAbs.
   IMPORTANCE It is unclear why severity of RSV disease peaks at the age when infants have neutralizing levels of maternal antibodies. Additionally, the exact reason for FI-RSV-induced enhanced disease, as seen in the 1960s vaccine trials, is still unclear. We hypothesized that antibodies present under either of these conditions could contribute to disease severity. Antibodies can have effects that may lead to more disease instead of protection. We investigated two of those effects: antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) and neutralization reduction. We show that ADE occurs in vitro with antibodies from FI-RSV-immunized RSV-infected cotton rats. Moreover, passively acquired maternal antibodies from infants had the capacity to induce ADE and reduction of neutralization. However, no clear association with disease severity was seen, ruling out that these properties explain disease in the presence of maternal antibodies. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the impact of antibodies on RSV disease in infants.

AB Virion transmembrane proteins (VTPs) mediate key functions in the herpesvirus infectious cycle. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the archetype of fish alloherpesviruses. The present study was devoted to CyHV-3 VTPs. Using mass spectrometry approaches, we identified 16 VTPs of the CyHV-3 FL strain. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that eight of these proteins are essential for viral growth in vitro (open reading frame 32 [ORF32], ORF59, ORF81, ORF83, ORF99, ORF106, ORF115, and ORF131), and eight are nonessential (ORF25, ORF64, ORF65, ORF108, ORF132, ORF136, ORF148, and ORF149). Among the nonessential proteins, deletion of ORF25, ORF132, ORF136, ORF148, or ORF149 affects viral replication in vitro, and deletion of ORF25, ORF64, ORF108, ORF132, or ORF149 impacts plaque size. Lack of ORF148 or ORF25 causes attenuation in vivo to a minor or major extent, respectively. The safety and efficacy of a virus lacking ORF25 were compared to those of a previously described vaccine candidate deleted for ORF56 and ORF57 (.56-57). Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrated that the ORF25 deleted virus infects fish through skin infection and then spreads to internal organs as reported previously for the wild-type parental virus and the.56-57 virus. However, compared to the parental wild-type virus, the replication of the ORF25-deleted virus was reduced in intensity and duration to levels similar to those observed for the.56-57 virus. Vaccination of fish with a virus lacking ORF25 was safe but had low efficacy at the doses tested. This characterization of the virion transmembrane proteome of CyHV-3 provides a firm basis for further research on alloherpesvirus VTPs.
   IMPORTANCE Virion transmembrane proteins play key roles in the biology of herpesviruses. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the archetype of fish alloherpesviruses and the causative agent of major economic losses in common and koi carp worldwide. In this study of the virion transmembrane proteome of CyHV-3, the major findings were: (i) the FL strain encodes 16 virion transmembrane proteins; (ii) eight of these proteins are essential for viral growth in vitro; (iii) seven of the nonessential proteins affect viral growth in vitro, and two affect virulence in vivo; and (iv) a mutant lacking ORF25 is highly attenuated but induces moderate immune protection. This study represents a major breakthrough in understanding the biology of CyHV-3 and will contribute to the development of prophylactic methods. It also provides a firm basis for the further research on alloherpesvirus virion transmembrane proteins.

   MANAGEMENT
AB Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus, is a major cause of acute viral encephalitis in humans. No approved drug is available for the specific treatment of JEV infections, and the available vaccines are not effective against all clinical JEV isolates. In the study described here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of JEV was performed. Five hit drugs that inhibited JEV infection with a selective index of >10 were identified. The antiviral activities of these five hit drugs against other flavivirus, including Zika virus, were also validated. As three of the five hit drugs were calcium inhibitors, additional types of calcium inhibitors that confirmed that calcium is essential for JEV infection, most likely during viral replication, were utilized. Adaptive mutant analysis uncovered that replacement of Q130, located in transmembrane domain 3 of the nonstructural NS4B protein, which is relatively conserved in flaviviruses, with R or K conferred JEV resistance to manidipine, a voltage-gated Ca2(+) channel (VGCC) inhibitor, without an apparent loss of the viral growth profile. Furthermore, manidipine was indicated to protect mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while it abrogated the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. This study provides five antiflavivirus candidates and identifies cytoplasmic calcium to be a novel antiviral target for the treatment of JEV infection. The findings reported here provide therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by flaviviruses.
   IMPORTANCE No approved therapy for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis virus infection is currently available. Repurposing of approved drugs would accelerate the development of a therapeutic stratagem. In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs and identified five hit drugs, especially calcium inhibitors, exerting antiflavivirus activity that blocked viral replication. The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of manidipine were investigated with a mouse model of JEV infection, and the viral target was identified by generating an adaptive mutant.

AB Elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) responses is a major goal for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Current HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) vaccine candidates elicit predominantly tier 1 and/or autologous tier 2 virus neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses, as well as weak and/or sporadic cross-reactive tier 2 virus NAb responses with unknown specificity. To delineate the specificity of vaccine-elicited cross-reactive tier 2 virus NAb responses, we performed single memory B cell sorting from the peripheral blood of a rhesus macaque immunized with YU2gp140-F trimers in adjuvant, using JR-FL SOSIP. 664, a native Env trimer mimetic, as a sorting probe to isolate monoclonal Abs (MAbs). We found striking genetic and functional convergence of the SOSIP-sorted Ig repertoire, with predominant VH4 or VH5 gene family usage and Env V3 specificity. Of these vaccine-elicited V3-specific MAbs, nearly 20% (6/33) displayed cross-reactive tier 2 virus neutralization, which recapitulated the serum neutralization capacity. Substantial similarities in binding specificity, neutralization breadth and potency, and sequence/structural homology were observed between selected macaque cross-reactive V3 NAbs elicited by vaccination and prototypic V3 NAbs derived from natural infections in humans, highlighting the convergence of this subset of primate V3-specific B cell repertories. Our study demonstrated that cross-reactive primary virus neutralizing B cell lineages could be elicited by vaccination as detected using a standardized panel of tier 2 viruses. Whether these lineages could be expanded to acquire increased breadth and potency of neutralization merits further investigation.
   IMPORTANCE Elicitation of antibody responses capable of neutralizing diverse HIV-1 primary virus isolates (designated broadly neutralizing antibodies [bNAbs]) remains a high priority for the vaccine field. bNAb responses were so far observed only in response to natural infection within a subset of individuals. To achieve this goal, an improved understanding of vaccine-elicited responses, including at the monoclonal Ab level, is essential. Here, we isolated and characterized a panel of vaccine-elicited cross-reactive neutralizing MAbs targeting the Env V3 loop that moderately neutralized several primary viruses and recapitulated the serum neutralizing antibody response. Striking similarities between the cross-reactive V3 NAbs elicited by vaccination in macaques and natural infections in humans illustrate commonalities between the vaccine- and infection-induced responses to V3 and support the feasibility of exploring the V3 epitope as a HIV-1 vaccine target in nonhuman primates.

AB Efficient transmission from human to human is the prerequisite for an influenza virus to cause a pandemic; however, the molecular determinants of influenza virus transmission are still largely unknown. In this study, we explored the molecular basis for transmission of Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EAH1N1) swine influenza viruses by comparing two viruses that are genetically similar but differ in their transmissibility in guinea pigs: the A/swine/Guangxi/18/2011 virus (GX/18) is highly transmissible by respiratory droplet in guinea pigs, whereas the A/swine/Heilongjiang/ 27/2012 virus (HLJ/27) does not transmit in this animal model. We used reverse genetics to generate a series of reassortants and mutants in the GX/18 background and tested their transmissibility in guinea pigs. We found that a single-amino-acid substitution of glycine (G) for glutamic acid (E) at position 225 (E225G) in the HA1 protein completely abolished the respiratory droplet transmission of GX/18, whereas the substitution of E for G at the same position (G225E) in HA1 enabled HLJ/27 to transmit in guinea pigs. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that viruses bearing 225E in HA1 replicated more rapidly than viruses bearing 225G due to differences in assembly and budding efficiencies. Our study indicates that the amino acid 225E in HA1 plays a key role in EAH1N1 swine influenza virus transmission and provides important information for evaluating the pandemic potential of field influenza virus strains.
   IMPORTANCE Efficient transmission among humans is a prerequisite for a novel influenza virus to cause a human pandemic. Transmissibility of influenza viruses is a polygenic trait, and understanding the genetic determinants for transmissibility will provide useful insights for evaluating the pandemic potential of influenza viruses in the field. Several amino acids in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza viruses have been shown to be important for transmissibility, usually by increasing virus affinity for human-type receptors. In this study, we explored the genetic basis of the transmissibility difference between two Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EAH1N1) swine influenza viruses in guinea pigs and found that the amino acid glutamic acid at position 225 in the HA1 protein plays a critical role in the transmission of EAH1N1 virus by increasing the efficiency of viral assembly and budding.

AB A novel archaeal lytic virus targeting species of the genus Methanosarcina was isolated using Methanosarcina mazei strain Go1 as the host. Due to its spherical morphology, the virus was designated Methanosarcina spherical virus (MetSV). Molecular analysis demonstrated that MetSV contains double-stranded linear DNA with a genome size of 10,567 bp containing 22 open reading frames (ORFs), all oriented in the same direction. Functions were predicted for some of these ORFs, i.e., such as DNA polymerase, ATPase, and DNA-binding protein as well as envelope (structural) protein. MetSV-derived spacers in CRISPR loci were detected in several published Methanosarcina draft genomes using bioinformatic tools, revealing a potential protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) motif (TTA/T). Transcription and expression of several predicted viral ORFs were validated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), PAGE analysis, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics. Analysis of core lipids by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectrometry showed that MetSV and Methanosarcina mazei both contain archaeol and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether without a cyclopentane moiety (GDGT-0). The MetSV host range is limited to Methanosarcina strains growing as single cells (M. mazei, Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina soligelidi). In contrast, strains growing as sarcina-like aggregates were apparently protected from infection. Heterogeneity related to morphology phases in M. mazei cultures allowed acquisition of resistance to MetSV after challenge by growing cultures as sarcina-like aggregates. CRISPR/Cas-mediated resistance was excluded since neither of the two CRISPR arrays showed MetSV-derived spacer acquisition. Based on these findings, we propose that changing the morphology from single cells to sarcina-like aggregates upon rearrangement of the envelope structure prevents infection and subsequent lysis by MetSV.
   IMPORTANCE Methanoarchaea are among the most abundant organisms on the planet since they are present in high numbers in major anaerobic environments. They convert various carbon sources, e.g., acetate, methylamines, or methanol, to methane and carbon dioxide; thus, they have a significant impact on the emission of major greenhouse gases. Today, very little is known about viruses specifically infecting methanoarchaea that most probably impact the abundance of methanoarchaea in microbial consortia. Here, we characterize the first identified Methanosarcina-infecting virus (MetSV) and show a mechanism for acquiring resistance against MetSV. Based on our results, we propose that growth as sarcina-like aggregates prevents infection and subsequent lysis. These findings allow new in-sights into the virus-host relationship in methanogenic community structures, their dynamics, and their phase heterogeneity. Moreover, the availability of a specific virus provides new possibilities to deepen our knowledge of the defense mechanisms of potential hosts and offers tools for genetic manipulation.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) persistently infects 40% to 100% of the human population worldwide. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates that humoral immunity to HCMV plays an important role in restricting virus dissemination and protecting the infected host from disease. Specific immunoglobulin preparations from pooled plasma of adults selected for high titers of HCMV antibodies have been used for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients and pregnant women. Even though incubation of HCMV particles with these preparations leads to the neutralization of viral infectivity, it is still unclear whether the antibody-treated HCMV particles (referred to here as HCMV-Ab) enter the cells and modulate antiviral immune responses. Here we demonstrate that HCMV-Ab did enter macrophages. HCMV-Ab did not initiate the expression of immediate early antigens (IEAs) in macrophages, but they induced an antiviral state and rendered the cells less susceptible to HCMV infection upon challenge. Resistance to HCMV infection seemed to be due to the activation of intrinsic restriction factors and was independent of interferons. In contrast to actively infected cells, autologous NK cells did not degranulate against HCMV-Ab-treated macrophages, suggesting that these cells may not be eliminated by innate effector cells. Interestingly, HCMV-Ab-treated macrophages stimulated the proliferation of autologous adaptive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Our findings not only expand the current knowledge on virus-antibody immunity but may also be relevant for future vaccination strategies.
   IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a common herpesvirus, establishes benign but persistent infections in immunocompetent hosts. However, in subjects with an immature or dysfunctional immune system, HCMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Passive immunization has been used in different clinical settings with variable clinical results. Intravenous hyperimmune globulin preparations (IVIg) are obtained from pooled adult human plasma selected for high anti-CMV antibody titers. While HCMV neutralization can be shown in vitro using different systems, data are lacking regarding the cross-influence of IVIg administration on the cellular immune responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of IVIg on distinct components of the immune response against HCMV, including antigen presentation by macrophages, degranulation of innate natural killer cells, and proliferation of adaptive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.

AB Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus characterized by diarrhea and high morbidity rates, and the mortality rate is 100% in piglets less than 2 weeks old. Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1 beta(IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-beta) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF-beta is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin beta 5 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin beta 5 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection.
   IMPORTANCE Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin beta 5 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin beta 5 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection. Our results provide new insights into secondary infection and suggest that targeted anti-EMT therapy may have implications for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection.

AB The genomes of human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and HHV-6B have the capacity to integrate into telomeres, the essential capping structures of chromosomes that play roles in cancer and ageing. About 1% of people worldwide are carriers of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6), which is inherited as a genetic trait. Understanding the consequences of integration for the evolution of the viral genome, for the telomere, and for the risk of disease associated with carrier status is hampered by a lack of knowledge about ciHHV-6 genomes. Here, we report an analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that they are significantly divergent from the few modern nonintegrated HHV-6 strains for which complete sequences are currently available. In addition, ciHHV-6B genomes in Europeans are more closely related to each other than to ciHHV-6B genomes from China and Pakistan, suggesting regional variation of the trait. Remarkably, at least one group of European ciHHV-6B carriers has inherited the same ciHHV-6B genome, integrated in the same telomere allele, from a common ancestor estimated to have existed 24,500 +/- 10,600 years ago. Despite the antiquity of some, and possibly most, germ line HHV-6 integrations, the majority of ciHHV-6B (95%) and ciHHV-6A (72%) genomes contain a full set of intact viral genes and therefore appear to have the capacity for viral gene expression and full reactivation.
   IMPORTANCE Inheritance of HHV-6A or HHV-6B integrated into a telomere occurs at a low frequency in most populations studied to date, but its characteristics are poorly understood. However, stratification of ciHHV-6 carriers in modern populations due to common ancestry is an important consideration for genome-wide association studies that aim to identify disease risks for these people. Here, we present full sequence analysis of 28 ciHHV-6 genomes and show that ciHHV-6B in many carriers with European ancestry most likely originated from ancient integration events in a small number of ancestors. We propose that ancient ancestral origins for ciHHV-6A and ciHHV-6B are also likely in other populations. Moreover, despite their antiquity, all of the ciHHV-6 genomes appear to retain the capacity to express viral genes, and most are predicted to be capable of full viral reactivation. These discoveries represent potentially important considerations in immunocompromised patients, in particular in organ transplantation and in stem cell therapy.

AB The nonstructural protein NS3 from the Flaviviridae family is a multifunctional protein that contains an N-terminal protease and a C-terminal helicase, playing essential roles in viral polyprotein processing and genome replication. Here we report a full-length crystal structure of the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS3 in complex with its NS4A protease cofactor segment (PCS) at a 2.35-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a previously unidentified similar to 2,200-angstrom(2) intramolecular protease-helicase interface comprising three clusters of interactions, representing a "closed" global conformation related to the NS3-NS4A cis-cleavage event. Although this conformation is incompatible with protease trans-cleavage, it appears to be functionally important and beneficial to the helicase activity, as the mutations designed to perturb this conformation impaired both the helicase activities in vitro and virus production in vivo. Our work reveals important features of protease-helicase coordination in pestivirus NS3 and provides a key basis for how different conformational states may explicitly contribute to certain functions of this natural protease-helicase fusion protein.
   IMPORTANCE Many RNA viruses encode helicases to aid their RNA genome replication and transcription by unwinding structured RNA. Being naturally fused to a protease participating in viral polyprotein processing, the NS3 helicases encoded by the Flaviviridae family viruses are unique. Therefore, how these two enzyme modules coordinate in a single polypeptide is of particular interest. Here we report a previously unidentified conformation of pestivirus NS3 in complex with its NS4A protease cofactor segment (PCS). This conformational state is related to the protease cis-cleavage event and is optimal for the function of helicase. This work provides an important basis to understand how different enzymatic activities of NS3 may be achieved by the coordination between the protease and helicase through different conformational states.

AB Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are the newest class of antiretrovirals to be approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Canonical resistance to these competitive inhibitors develops through substitutions in the integrase active site that disrupt drug-protein interactions. However, resistance against the newest integrase inhibitor, dolutegravir (DTG), is associated with an R263K substitution at the C terminus of integrase that causes resistance through an unknown mechanism. The integrase C-terminal domain is involved in many processes over the course of infection and is posttranslationally modified via acetylation of three lysine residues that are important for enzyme activity, integrase multimerization, and protein-protein interactions. Here we report that regulation of the acetylation of integrase is integral to the replication of HIV in the presence of DTG and that the R263K mutation specifically disrupts this regulation, likely due to enhancement of interactions with the histone deacetylase I complex, as suggested by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Although no detectable differences in the levels of cell-free acetylation of the wild-type (WT) and mutated R263K enzymes were observed, the inhibition of cellular histone acetyltransferase enzymes sensitized the NL4.3(WT) virus to DTG, while NL4.3(R263K) was almost completely unaffected. When levels of endogenous acetylation were manipulated in virus-producing cells, inhibitors of acetylation enhanced the replication of NL4.3R263K, whereas inhibition of deacetylation greatly diminished the replication of NL4.3WT. Taken together, these results point to a pivotal role of acetylation in the resistance mechanism of HIV to some second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors, such as DTG.
   IMPORTANCE This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the influence of post-translational modifications on HIV drug resistance. Both viral replication and resistance to second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors of both WT and INSTI-resistant HIV strains were differentially affected by acetylation, likely as a result of altered interactions between integrase and the cellular deacetylation machinery. Many "shock and kill" strategies to eradicate HIV manipulate endogenous levels of acetylation in order to reactivate latent HIV. However, our results suggest that some drug-resistant viruses may differentially respond to such stimulation, which may complicate the attainment of this goal. Our future work will further illuminate the mechanisms involved.

AB Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infection induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha, which promotes the formation of discrete cytoplasmic inclusions, termed stress granules (SGs). SGs are emerging as a component of the innate immune response to virus infection, and modulation of SG assembly is a common mechanism employed by viruses to counter this antiviral response. We previously showed that MRV infection induces SGs early and then interferes with SG formation as infection proceeds. In this work, we found that SG-associated proteins localized to the periphery of virus-encoded cytoplasmic structures, termed virus factories (VFs), where viral transcription, translation, and replication occur. The localization of SG proteins to VFs was dependent on polysome dissociation and occurred via association of the SG effector protein, Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), with the MRV nonstructural protein sigma NS, which localizes to VFs via association with VF nucleating protein, mu NS. Deletion analysis of the sigma NS RNA binding domain and G3BP1 RNA (RRM) and ribosomal (RGG) binding domains showed that sigma NS association and VF localization phenotypes of G3BP1 do not occur solely through RNA or ribosomal binding but require both the RRM and RGG domains of G3BP1 for maximal viral-factory-like structure (VFL) localization and sigma NS association. Coexpression of sigma NS and mu NS resulted in disruption of normal SG puncta, and in cells lacking G3BP1, MRV replication was enhanced in a manner correlating with strain-dependent induction of host translation shutoff. These results suggest that sigma NS association with G3BP1 and relocalization of G3BP1 to the VF periphery play roles in SG disruption to facilitate MRV replication in the host translational shutoff environment.
   IMPORTANCE SGs and SG effector proteins have emerged as important, yet poorly understood, players in the host's innate immune response to virus infection. MRV infection induces SGs early during infection that are dispersed and/or prevented from forming during late stages of infection despite continued activation of the eIF2 alpha signaling pathway. Cellular and viral components involved in disruption of SGs during late stages of MRV infection remain to be elucidated. This work provides evidence that MRV disruption of SGs may be facilitated by association of the MRV nonstructural protein sigma NS with the major SG effector protein G3BP1 and subsequent localization of G3BP1 and other SG-associated proteins around the peripheries of virus-encoded factories, interrupting the normal formation of SGs. Our findings also reveal the importance of G3BP1 as an inhibitor of MRV replication during infection for the first time.

TI Filling Knowledge Gaps for Mimivirus Entry, Uncoating, and Morphogenesis

AB Since the discovery of mimivirus, its unusual structural and genomic features have raised great interest in the study of its biology; however, many aspects concerning its replication cycle remain uncertain. In this study, extensive analyses of electron microscope images, as well as biological assay results, shed light on unclear points concerning the mimivirus replication cycle. We found that treatment with cytochalasin, a phagocytosis inhibitor, negatively impacted the incorporation of mimivirus particles by Acanthamoeba castellanii, causing a negative effect on viral growth in amoeba monolayers. Treatment of amoebas with bafilomicin significantly impacted mimivirus uncoating and replication. In conjunction with microscopic analyses, these data suggest that mimiviruses indeed depend on phagocytosis for entry into amoebas, and particle uncoating (and stargate opening) appears to be dependent on phagosome acidification. In-depth analyses of particle morphogenesis suggest that the mimivirus capsids are assembled from growing lamellar structures. Despite proposals from previous studies that genome acquisition occurs before the acquisition of fibrils, our results clearly demonstrate that the genome and fibrils can be acquired simultaneously. Our data suggest the existence of a specific area surrounding the core of the viral factory where particles acquire the surface fibrils. Furthermore, we reinforce the concept that defective particles can be formed even in the absence of virophages. Our work provides new information about unexplored steps in the life cycle of mimivirus.
   IMPORTANCE Investigating the viral life cycle is essential to a better understanding of virus biology. The combination of biological assays and microscopic images allows a clear view of the biological features of viruses. Since the discovery of mimivirus, many studies have been conducted to characterize its replication cycle, but many knowledge gaps remain to be filled. In this study, we conducted a new examination of the replication cycle of mimivirus and provide new evidence concerning some stages of the cycle which were previously unclear, mainly entry, uncoating, and morphogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that atypical virion morphologies can occur even in the absence of virophages. Our results, along with previous data, allow us to present an ultimate model for the mimivirus replication cycle.

AB A hallmark of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is reverse transcription of genomic RNA to DNA, a process that is primed by cellular tRNAs. HIV-1 recruits human tRNALys3 to serve as the reverse transcription primer via an interaction between lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. LysRS is normally sequestered in a multi-aminoacyltRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Previous studies demonstrated that components of the MSC can be mobilized in response to certain cellular stimuli, but how LysRS is redirected from the MSC to viral particles for packaging is unknown. Here, we show that upon HIV-1 infection, a free pool of non-MSC-associated LysRS is observed and partially relocalized to the nucleus. Heat inactivation of HIV-1 blocks nuclear localization of LysRS, but treatment with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor does not, suggesting that the trigger for relocalization occurs prior to reverse transcription. A reduction in HIV-1 infection is observed upon treatment with an inhibitor to mitogen-activated protein kinase that prevents phosphorylation of LysRS on Ser207, release of LysRS from the MSC, and nuclear localization. A phosphomimetic mutant of LysRS (S207D) that lacked the capability to aminoacylate tRNALys3 localized to the nucleus, rescued HIV-1 infectivity, and was packaged into virions. In contrast, a phosphoablative mutant (S207A) remained cytosolic and maintained full aminoacylation activity but failed to rescue infectivity and was not packaged. These findings suggest that HIV-1 takes advantage of the dynamic nature of the MSC to redirect and coopt cellular translation factors to enhance viral replication.
   IMPORTANCE Human tRNALys3, the primer for reverse transcription, and LysRS are essential host factors packaged into HIV-1 virions. Previous studies found that tRNALys3 packaging depends on interactions between LysRS and HIV-1 Gag; however, many details regarding the mechanism of tRNALys3 and LysRS packaging remain unknown. LysRS is normally sequestered in a high-molecular-weight multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), restricting the pool of free LysRS-tRNALys. Mounting evidence suggests that LysRS is released under a variety of stimuli to perform alternative functions within the cell. Here, we show that HIV-1 infection results in a free pool of LysRS that is relocalized to the nucleus of target cells. Blocking this pathway in HIV-1-producing cells resulted in less infectious progeny virions. Understanding the mechanism by which LysRS is recruited into the viral assembly pathway can be exploited for the development of specific and effective therapeutics targeting this nontranslational function.

AB borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes a severe and potentially fatal neuroinfection in humans. Despite its high medical relevance, no specific antiviral therapy is currently available. Here we demonstrate that treatment with a nucleoside analog, 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine (7-deaza-2'-CMA), substantially improved disease outcomes, increased survival, and reduced signs of neuroinfection and viral titers in the brains of mice infected with a lethal dose of TBEV. To investigate the mechanism of action of 7-deaza-2'-CMA, two drug-resistant TBEV clones were generated and characterized. The two clones shared a signature amino acid substitution, S603T, in the viral NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. This mutation conferred resistance to various 2'-C-methylated nucleoside derivatives, but no cross-resistance was seen with other nucleoside analogs, such as 4'-C-azidocytidine and 2'-deoxy-2'-beta-hydroxy-4'-azidocytidine (RO-9187). All-atom molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the S603T RdRp mutant repels a water molecule that coordinates the position of a metal ion cofactor as 2'-C-methylated nucleoside analogs approach the active site. To investigate its phenotype, the S603T mutation was introduced into a recombinant TBEV strain (Oshima-IC) generated from an infectious cDNA clone and into a TBEV replicon that expresses a reporter luciferase gene (Oshima-REP- luc2A). The mutants were replication impaired, showing reduced growth and a small plaque size in mammalian cell culture and reduced levels of neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in rodent models. These results indicate that TBEV resistance to 2'-C-methylated nucleoside inhibitors is conferred by a single conservative mutation that causes a subtle atomic effect within the active site of the viral NS5 RdRp and is associated with strong attenuation of the virus.
   IMPORTANCE This study found that the nucleoside analog 7-deaza-2'-C-methyl-adenosine (7-deaza-2'-CMA) has high antiviral activity against tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in large areas of Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. Treating mice infected with a lethal dose of TBEV with 7-deaza-2'-CMA resulted in significantly higher survival rates and reduced the severity of neurological signs of the disease. Thus, this compound shows promise for further development as an anti-TBEV drug. It is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works and to develop guidelines for patient treatment. We generated TBEV mutants that were resistant not only to 7-deaza-2'-CMA but also to a broad range of other 2'-C-methylated antiviral medications. Our findings suggest that combination therapy may be used to improve treatment and reduce the emergence of drug-resistant viruses during nucleoside analog therapy for TBEV infection.

AB Hosts and viruses are locked in an evolutionary arms race. Hosts are constantly evolving to suppress virulence and replication, while viruses, which are reliant on host machinery for survival and reproduction, develop counterstrategies to escape this immune defense. Viruses must also adapt to novel conditions while establishing themselves in a host species. Both processes provide strong selection for viral adaptation. Understanding adaptive evolution in insect viruses can help us to better understand adaptive evolution in general and is important due to the use of these viruses as biocontrol agents and for protecting ecologically or economically important species from outbreaks. Here we examine the molecular evolution of baculoviruses and nudiviruses, a group of insect-infecting viruses with key roles in biocontrol. We looked for signatures of selection between genomes of baculoviruses infecting a range of species and within a population of baculoviruses. Both analyses found only a few strong signatures of positive selection, primarily in replication- and transcription-associated genes and several structural protein genes. In both analyses, we detected a conserved complex of genes, including the helicase gene, showing consistently high levels of adaptive evolution, suggesting that they may be key in antagonistic coevolution to escape host suppression. These genes are integral to the baculovirus life cycle and may be good focal genes for developing baculoviruses as effective biocontrol agents or for targeting baculoviruses infecting ecologically relevant species. Recombination and complex genomes make evolution in these double stranded DNA viruses more efficient than that in smaller RNA viruses with error prone replication, as seen via signatures of selection in specific genes within a population of baculoviruses.
   IMPORTANCE Most viral evolutionary studies focus on RNA viruses. While these viruses cause many human and animal diseases, such studies leave us with a lesser understanding of how DNA viruses adapt to hosts and how the host responds to these pathogens. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of baculoviruses, a group of insect-infecting DNA viruses, many of which have been used in biocontrol. We find that most of the genome is under purifying selection, with only a few key genes evolving adaptively. Our results provide a glimpse into how DNA viruses differ from RNA viruses in their evolutionary dynamics and identify genes that are key to DNA virus adaptation, improving our understanding of how this group of pathogens evolves.

AB Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are recognized by the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and result in activation of the DNA-PK and ATM kinases, which play key roles in regulating the cellular DNA damage response (DDR). DNA tumor viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are known to interact extensively with the DDR during the course of their replicative cycles. Here we show that during lytic amplification of KSHV DNA, the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the MRN complex consistently colocalize with viral genomes in replication compartments (RCs), whereas other DSB repair proteins form foci outside RCs. Depletion of MRE11 and abrogation of its exonuclease activity negatively impact viral replication, while in contrast, knockdown of Ku80 and inhibition of the DNA-PK enzyme, which are involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, enhance amplification of viral DNA. Although the recruitment of DSB-sensing proteins to KSHV RCs is a consistent occurrence across multiple cell types, activation of the ATM-CHK2 pathway during viral replication is a cell line-specific event, indicating that recognition of viral DNA by the DDR does not necessarily result in activation of downstream signaling pathways. We have also observed that newly replicated viral DNA is not associated with cellular histones. Since the presence and modification of these DNA-packaging proteins provide a scaffold for docking of multiple DNA repair factors, the absence of histone deposition may allow the virus to evade localization of DSB repair proteins that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on viral replication.
   IMPORTANCE Tumor viruses are known to interact with machinery responsible for detection and repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, although detail concerning how Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) modulates these cellular pathways during its lytic replication phase was previously lacking. By undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the localization of DSB repair proteins during KSHV replication, we have determined that a DNA damage response (DDR) is directed to viral genomes but is distinct from the response to cellular DNA damage. We also demonstrate that although recruitment of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) DSB-sensing complex to viral genomes and activation of the ATM kinase can promote KSHV replication, proteins involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair restrict amplification of viral DNA. Overall, this study extends our understanding of the virus-host interactions that occur during lytic replication of KSHV and provides a deeper insight into how the DDR is manipulated during viral infection.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causees neurologic complications, including Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities in fetuses. We investigated the immune response, especially the CD8(+) T cell response in C57BL/6 (B6) wild-type (WT) mice, during ZIKV infection. We found that a robust CD8(+) T cell response was elicited, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified, a tetramer that recognizes ZIKV-specific CD8(+) T cells was developed, and virus-specific memory CD8(+) T cells were generated in these mice. The CD8(+) T cells from these infected mice were functional, as evidenced by the fact that the adoptive transfer of ZIKV-specific CD8(+) T cells could prevent ZIKV infection in the CNS and was cross protective against dengue virus infection. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into immune responses against ZIKV and further demonstrate that WT mice could be a natural and easy-access model for evaluating immune responses to ZIKV infection.
   IMPORTANCE ZIKV infection has severe clinical consequences, including Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, microcephaly, and congenital malformations in fetuses and newborn infants. Therefore, study of the immune response, especially the adaptive immune response to ZIKV infection, is important for understanding diseases caused by ZIKV infection. Here, we characterized the CD8(+) T cell immune response to ZIKV in a comprehensive manner and identified ZIKV epitopes. Using the identified immunodominant epitopes, we developed a tetramer that recognizes ZIKV-specific CD8(+) T cells in vivo, which simplified the detection and evaluation of ZIKV-specific immune responses. In addition, the finding that tetramer-positive memory CD8(+) T cell responses were generated and that CD8(+) T cells can traffic to a ZIKV-infected brain greatly enhances our understanding of ZIKV infection and provides important insights for ZIKV vaccine design.

AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most prevalent worldwide cause of severe respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) also causes severe pediatric respiratory illness, especially croup. Both viruses lack vaccines. Here, we describe the preclinical development of a bivalent RSV/HPIV1 vaccine based on a recombinant HPIV1 vector, attenuated by a stabilized mutation, that expresses RSV F protein modified for increased stability in the prefusion (pre-F) conformation by previously described disulfide bond (DS) and hydrophobic cavity-filling (Cav1) mutations. RSV F was expressed from the first or second gene position as the full-length protein or as a chimeric protein with its transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail (TMCT) domains substituted with those of HPIV1 F in an effort to direct packaging in the vector particles. All constructs were recovered by reverse genetics. The TMCT versions of RSV F were packaged in the rHPIV1 particles much more efficiently than their full-length counterparts. In hamsters, the presence of the RSV F gene, and in particular the TMCT versions, was attenuating and resulted in reduced immunogenicity. However, the vector expressing full-length RSV F from the pre-N position was immunogenic for RSV and HPIV1. It conferred complement-independent high-quality RSV-neutralizing antibodies at titers similar to those of wild-type RSV and provided protection against RSV challenge. The vectors exhibited stable RSV F expression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, an attenuated rHPIV1 vector expressing a pre-F-stabilized form of RSV F demonstrated promising immunogenicity and should be further developed as an intranasal pediatric vaccine.
   IMPORTANCE RSV and HPIV1 are major viral causes of acute pediatric respiratory illness for which no vaccines or suitable antiviral drugs are available. The RSV F glycoprotein is the major RSV neutralization antigen. We used a rHPIV1 vector, bearing a stabilized attenuating mutation, to express the RSV F glycoprotein bearing amino acid substitutions that increase its stability in the pre-F form, the most immunogenic form that elicits highly functional virus-neutralizing antibodies. RSV F was expressed from the pre-N or N-P gene position of the rHPIV1 vector as a full-length protein or as a chimeric form with its TMCT domain derived from HPIV1 F. TMCT modification greatly increased packaging of RSV F into the vector particles but also increased vector attenuation in vivo, resulting in reduced immunogenicity. In contrast, full-length RSV F expressed from the pre-N position was immunogenic, eliciting complement-independent RSV-neutralizing antibodies and providing protection against RSV challenge.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused significant outbreaks and epidemics in the Americas recently, raising global concern due to its ability to cause microcephaly and other neurological complications. A stable and efficient infectious clone of ZIKV is urgently needed. However, the instability and toxicity of flavivirus cDNA clones in Escherichia coli hosts has hindered the development of ZIKV infectious clones. Here, using a novel self-splicing ribozyme-based strategy, we generated a stable infectious cDNA clone of a contemporary ZIKV strain imported from Venezuela to China in 2016. The constructed clone contained a modified version of the group II self-splicing intron P.li.LSUI2 near the junction between the E and NS1 genes, which were removed from the RNA transcripts by an easy-to-establish in vitro splicing reaction. Transfection of the spliced RNAs into BHK-21 cells led to the production of infectious progeny virus that resembled the parental virus. Finally, potential cis-acting RNA elements in ZIKV genomic RNA were identified based on this novel reverse genetics system, and the critical role of 5'-SLA promoter and 5'-3' cyclization sequences were characterized by a combination of different assays. Our results provide another stable and reliable reverse genetics system for ZIKV that will help study ZIKV infection and pathogenesis, and the novel self-splicing intron-based strategy could be further expanded for the construction of infectious clones from other emerging and reemerging flaviviruses.
   IMPORTANCE The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have drawn global concern due to the unexpected causal link to fetus microcephaly and other severe neurological complications. The infectious cDNA clones of ZIKV are critical for the research community to study the virus, understand the disease, and inform vaccine design and antiviral screening. A panel of existing technologies have been utilized to develop ZIKV infectious clones. Here, we successfully generated a stable infectious clone of a 2016 ZIKV strain using a novel self-splicing ribozyme-based technology that abolished the potential toxicity of ZIKV cDNA clones to the E. coli host. Moreover, two crucial cis-acting replication elements (5'-SLA and 5'-CS) of ZIKV were first identified using this novel reverse genetics system. This novel self-splicing ribozyme-based reverse genetics platform will be widely utilized in future ZIKV studies and provide insight for the development of infectious clones of other emerging viruses.

AB African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease of mandatory declaration to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The lack of available vaccines makes its control difficult; thus, African swine fever virus (ASFV) represents a major threat to the swine industry. Inactivated vaccines do not confer solid protection against ASFV. Conversely, live attenuated viruses (LAV), either naturally isolated or obtained by genetic manipulation, have demonstrated reliable protection against homologous ASFV strains, although little or no protection has been demonstrated against heterologous viruses. Safety concerns are a major issue for the use of ASFV attenuated vaccine candidates and have hampered their implementation in the field so far. While trying to develop safer and efficient ASFV vaccines, we found that the deletion of the viral CD2v (EP402R) gene highly attenuated the virulent BA71 strain in vivo. Inoculation of pigs with the deletion mutant virus BA71.CD2 conferred protection not only against lethal challenge with the parental BA71 but also against the heterologous E75 (both genotype I strains). The protection induced was dose dependent, and the cross-protection observed in vivo correlated with the ability of BA71.CD2 to induce specific CD8(+) T cells capable of recognizing both BA71 and E75 viruses in vitro. Interestingly, 100% of the pigs immunized with BA71.CD2 also survived lethal challenge with Georgia 2007/1, the genotype II strain of ASFV currently circulating in continental Europe. These results open new avenues to design ASFV cross-protective vaccines, essential to fight ASFV in areas where the virus is endemic and where multiple viruses are circulating.
   IMPORTANCE African swine fever virus (ASFV) remains enzootic in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, today representing a major threat for the development of their swine industry. The uncontrolled presence of ASFV has favored its periodic exportation to other countries, the last event being in Georgia in 2007. Since then, ASFV has spread toward neighboring countries, reaching the European Union's east border in 2014. The lack of available vaccines against ASFV makes its control difficult; so far, only live attenuated viruses have demonstrated solid protection against homologous experimental challenges, but they have failed at inducing solid cross-protective immunity against heterologous viruses. Here we describe a new LAV candidate with unique cross-protective abilities: BA71.CD2. Inoculation of BA71.CD2 protected pigs not only against experimental challenge with BA71, the virulent parental strain, but also against heterologous viruses, including Georgia 2007/1, the genotype II strain of ASFV currently circulating in Eastern Europe.

AB Our previous studies demonstrated that membrane-associated hepatitis E virus (HEV) particles-now considered "quasi-enveloped particles"-are present in the multivesicular body with intraluminal vesicles (exosomes) in infected cells and that the release of HEV virions is related to the exosomal pathway. In this study, we characterized exosomes purified from the culture supernatants of HEV-infected PLC/PRF/5 cells. Purified CD63-, CD9-, or CD81-positive exosomes derived from the culture supernatants of HEV-infected cells that had been cultivated in serum-free medium were found to contain HEV RNA and the viral capsid (ORF2) and ORF3 proteins, as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy, with or without prior detergent and protease treatment, revealed the presence of virus-like particles in the exosome fraction. These particles were 39.6 +/- 1.0 nm in diameter and were covered with a lipid membrane. After treatment with detergent and protease, the diameter of these virus-like particles was 26.9 +/- 0.9 nm, and the treated particles became accessible with an anti-HEV ORF2 monoclonal antibody (MAb). The HEV particles in the exosome fraction were capable of infecting naive PLC/PRF/5 cells but were not neutralized by an anti-HEV ORF2 MAb which efficiently neutralizes nonenveloped HEV particles in cell culture. These results indicate that the membrane-wrapped HEV particles released by the exosomal pathway are copurified with the exosomes in the exosome fraction and suggest that the capsids of HEV particles are individually covered by lipid membranes resembling those of exosomes, similar to enveloped viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E, caused by HEV, is an important infectious disease that is spreading worldwide. HEV infection can cause acute or fulminant hepatitis and can become chronic in immunocompromised hosts, including patients after organ transplantation. The HEV particles present in feces and bile are nonenveloped, while those in circulating blood and culture supernatants are covered with a cellular membrane, similar to enveloped viruses. Furthermore, these membrane-associated and -unassociated HEV particles can be propagated in cultured cells. The significance of our research is that the capsids of HEV particles are individually covered by a lipid membrane that resembles the membrane of exosomes, similar to enveloped viruses, and are released from infected cells via the exosomal pathway. These data will help to elucidate the entry mechanisms and receptors for HEV infection in the future. This is the first report to characterize the detailed morphological features of membrane-associated HEV particles.

AB Gut-homing alpha 4 beta 7(high) CD4(+) T lymphocytes have been shown to be preferentially targeted by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and are implicated in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Previous studies demonstrated that HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 binds and signals through alpha 4 beta 7 and that this likely contributes to the infection of alpha 4 beta 7(high) T cells and promotes cell-to-cell virus transmission. Structures within the second variable loop (V2) of gp120, including the tripeptide motif LDV/I, are thought to mediate gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 binding. However, lack of alpha 4 beta 7 binding has been reported in gp120 proteins containing LDV/I, and the precise determinants of gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 binding are not fully defined. In this work, we report the novel finding that fibronectins mediate indirect gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 interactions. We show that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells used to express recombinant gp120 produced fibronectins and other extracellular matrix proteins that copurified with gp120. CHO cell fibronectins were able to mediate the binding of a diverse panel of gp120 proteins to alpha 4 beta 7 in an in vitro cell binding assay. The V2 loop was not required for fibronectin-mediated binding of gp120 to alpha 4 beta 7, nor did V2-specific antibodies block this interaction. Removal of fibronectin through anion-exchange chromatography abrogated V2-independent gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 binding. Additionally, we showed a recombinant human fibronectin fragment mediated gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 interactions similarly to CHO cell fibronectin. These findings provide an explanation for the apparently contradictory observations regarding the gp120-alpha 4 beta 7 interaction and offer new insights into the potential role of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins in HIV-1 biology.
   IMPORTANCE Immune tissues within the gut are severely damaged by HIV-1, and this plays an important role in the development of AIDS. Integrin alpha 4 beta 7 plays a major role in the trafficking of lymphocytes, including CD4(+) T cells, into gut lymphoid tissues. Previous reports indicate that some HIV-1 gp120 envelope proteins bind to and signal through alpha 4 beta 7, which may help explain the preferential infection of gut CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular matrix proteins can mediate interactions between gp120 and alpha 4 beta 7. This suggests that the extracellular matrix may be an important mediator of HIV-1 interaction with alpha 4 beta 7-expressing cells. These findings provide new insight into the nature of HIV-1-alpha 4 beta 7 interactions and how these interactions may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that can cause significant neurological disease. Mouse models of WNV infection demonstrate that a proinflammatory environment is induced within the central nervous system (CNS) after WNV infection, leading to entry of activated peripheral immune cells. We utilized ex vivo spinal cord slice cultures (SCSC) to demonstrate that anti-inflammatory mechanisms may also play a role in WNV-induced pathology and/or recovery. Microglia are a type of macrophage that function as resident CNS immune cells. Similar to mouse models, infection of SCSC with WNV induces the upregulation of proinflammatory genes and proteins that are associated with microglial activation, including the microglial activation marker Iba1 and CC motif chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5. This suggests that microglia assume a proinflammatory phenotype in response to WNV infection similar to the proinflammatory (M1) activation that can be displayed by other macrophages. We now show that the WNV-induced expression of these and other proinflammatory genes was significantly decreased in the presence of minocycline, which has antineuroinflammatory properties, including the ability to inhibit proinflammatory microglial responses. Minocycline also caused a significant increase in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes associated with alternative anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage activation, including interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13, and FIZZ1. Minocycline-dependent alterations to M1/M2 gene expression were associated with a significant increase in survival of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in WNV-infected slices and markedly decreased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory environment induced by minocycline reduces viral cytotoxicity during WNV infection in ex vivo CNS tissue.
   IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality, with no specific therapeutic treatments available. Antiviral inflammatory responses are a crucial component of WNV pathology, and understanding how they are regulated is important for tailoring effective treatments. Proinflammatory responses during WNV infection have been extensively studied, but anti-inflammatory responses (and their potential protective and reparative capabilities) following WNV infection have not been investigated. Minocycline induced the expression of genes associated with the anti-inflammatory (M2) activation of CNS macrophages (microglia) in WNV-infected SCSC while inhibiting the expression of genes associated with proinflammatory (M1) macrophage activation and was protective for multiple CNS cell types, indicating its potential use as a therapeutic reagent. This ex vivo culture system can uniquely address the ability of CNS parenchymal cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) to respond to minocycline and to modulate the inflammatory environment and cytotoxicity in response to WNV infection without peripheral immune cell involvement.

AB Confirmed reports of Zika virus (ZIKV) in human seminal fluid for months after the clearance of viremia suggest the ability of ZIKV to establish persistent infection in the seminiferous tubules, an immune-privileged site in the testis protected by the blood-testis barrier, also called the Sertoli cell (SC) barrier (SCB). However, cellular targets of ZIKV in human testis and mechanisms by which the virus enters seminiferous tubules remain unclear. We demonstrate that primary human SCs were highly susceptible to ZIKV compared to the closely related dengue virus and induced the expression of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), key cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM-1] and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]). Furthermore, using an in vitro SCB model, we show that ZIKV was released on the adluminal side of the SCB model with a higher efficiency than in the blood-brain barrier model. ZIKV-infected SCs exhibited enhanced adhesion of leukocytes that correlated with decreases in SCB integrity. ZIKV infection did not affect the expression of tight and adherens junction proteins such as ZO-1, claudin, and JAM-A; however, exposure of SCs to inflammatory mediators derived from ZIKV-infected macrophages led to the degradation of the ZO-1 protein, which correlated with increased SCB permeability. Taken together, our data suggest that infection of SCs may be one of the crucial steps by which ZIKV gains access to the site of spermatozoon development and identify SCs as a therapeutic target to clear testicular infections. The SCB model opens up opportunities to assess interactions of SCs with other testicular cells and to test the ability of anti-ZIKV drugs to cross the barrier.
   IMPORTANCE Recent outbreaks of ZIKV, a neglected mosquito-borne flavivirus, have identified sexual transmission as a new route of disease spread, which has not been reported for other flaviviruses. To be able to sexually transmit for months after the clearance of viremia, ZIKV must establish infection in the seminiferous tubules, the site of spermatozoon development. However, little is known about the cell types that support ZIKV infection in the human testis. Currently, there are no models to study mechanisms of virus persistence in the seminiferous tubules. We provide evidence that ZIKV infection of human Sertoli cells, which are an important component of the seminiferous tubules, is robust and induces a strong antiviral response. The use of an in vitro Sertoli cell barrier to describe how ZIKV or inflammatory mediators derived from ZIKV-infected macrophages compromise barrier integrity will enable studies to explore the interactions of other testicular cells with Sertoli cells and to test novel antivirals for clearing testicular ZIKV infection.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes > 44 viral microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed throughout infection, can be detected in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumors, and manipulate several biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. Here, we show that EBV BHRF1-2 miRNAs block NF-kappa B activation following treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, specifically interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Analysis of EBV PAR-CLIP miRNA targetome data sets combined with pathway analysis revealed multiple BHRF1-2 miRNA targets involved in interleukin signaling pathways. By further analyzing changes in cellular gene expression patterns, we identified the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL1R1) as a direct target of miR-BHRF1-2-5p. Targeting the IL1R1 3' untranslated region (UTR) by EBV miR-BHRF1-2-5p was confirmed using 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assays and Western blot assays. Manipulation of EBV BHRF1-2 miRNA activity in latently infected B cells altered steady-state cytokine levels and disrupted IL-1 beta responsiveness. These studies demonstrate functionally relevant BHRF1-2 miRNA interactions during EBV infection, which is an important step in understanding their roles in pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE IL-1 signaling plays an important role in inflammation and early activation of host innate immune responses following virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that a viral miRNA downregulates the IL-1 receptor 1 during EBV infection, which consequently alters the responsiveness of cells to IL-1 stimuli and changes the cytokine expression levels within infected cell populations. We postulate that this viral miRNA activity not only disrupts IL-1 autocrine and paracrine signaling loops that can alert effector cells to sites of infection but also provides a survival advantage by dampening excessive inflammation that may be detrimental to the infected cell.

AB Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is expressed in multiple human malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin and immunosuppression-associated lymphomas. LMP1 mimics CD40 signaling to activate multiple growth and survival pathways, in particular, NF-kappa B. LMP1 has critical roles in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven B-cell transformation, and its expression causes fatal lymphoproliferative disease in immunosuppressed mice. Here, we review recent developments in studies of LMP1 signaling, LMP1-induced host dependency factors, mouse models of LMP1 lymphomagenesis, and anti-LMP1 immunotherapy approaches.

TI Murine Olfactory Bulb Interneurons Survive Infection with a Neurotropic

AB Viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is complicated by the mostly irreplaceable nature of neurons, as the loss of neurons has the potential to result in permanent damage to brain function. However, whether neurons or other cells in the CNS sometimes survive infection and the effects of infection on neuronal function is largely unknown. To address this question, we used the rJHM strain (rJ) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute encephalitis in susceptible strains of mice. To determine whether neurons or other CNS cells survive acute infection with this virulent virus, we developed a recombinant JHMV that expresses Cre recombinase (rJ-Cre) and infected mice that universally expressed a silent (floxed) version of tdTomato. Infection of these mice with rJ-Cre resulted in expression of tdTomato in host cells. The results showed that some cells were able to survive the infection, as demonstrated by continued tdTomato expression after virus antigen could no longer be detected. Most notably, interneurons in the olfactory bulb, which are known to be inhibitory, represented a large fraction of the surviving cells. In conclusion, our results indicated that some neurons are resistant to virus-mediated cell death and provide a framework for studying the effects of prior coronavirus infection on neuron function.
   IMPORTANCE We developed a novel recombinant virus that allows the study of cells that survive an infection by a central nervous system-specific strain of murine coronavirus. Using this virus, we identified neurons and, to a lesser extent, nonneuronal cells in the brain that were infected during the acute phase of the infection and survived for approximately 2 weeks until the mice succumbed to the infection. We focused on neurons and glial cells within the olfactory bulb because the virus enters the brain at this site. Our results show that interneurons of the olfactory bulb were the primary cell type able to survive infection. Further, these results indicate that this system will be useful for functional and gene expression studies of cells in the brain that survive acute infection.

AB Alphaherpesviruses that establish persistent infections rely partly on their ability to evade host antiviral responses, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. However, the mechanisms employed by alphaherpesviruses to avoid this response are not well understood. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an economically important pathogen and a useful model system for studying alphaherpesvirus biology. To identify PRV proteins that antagonize type I IFN signaling, we performed a screen by using an IFN-stimulated response element reporter in the swine cell line CRL. Unexpectedly, we identified the dUTPase UL50 as a strong inhibitor. We confirmed that UL50 has the ability to inhibit type I IFN signaling by performing ectopic expression of UL50 in cells and deletion of UL50 in PRV. Mechanistically, UL50 impeded type I IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, likely by accelerating lysosomal degradation of IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1). In addition, this UL50 activity was independent of its dUTPase activity and required amino acids 225 to 253 in the C-terminal region. The UL50 encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) also possessed similar activity. Moreover, UL50-deleted PRV was more susceptible to IFN than UL50-proficient PRV. Our results suggest that in addition to its dUTPase activity, the UL50 protein of alphaherpesviruses possesses the ability to suppress type I IFN signaling by promoting lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1, thereby contributing to immune evasion. This finding reveals UL50 as a potential antiviral target.
   IMPORTANCE Alphaherpesviruses can establish lifelong infections and cause many diseases in humans and animals. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a swine alphaherpesvirus that threatens pig production. Using PRV as a model, we found that this alphaherpesvirus could utilize its encoded dUTPase UL50 to induce IFNAR1 degradation and inhibit type I IFN signaling in an enzymatic activity-independent manner. Our finding reveals a mechanism employed by an alphaherpesvirus to evade the immune response and indicates that UL50 is an important viral protein in pathogenesis and is a potential target for antiviral drug development.

AB Antibodies bound to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein expressed by infected cells mobilize antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate the HIV-1-infected cells and thereby suppress HIV-1 infection and delay disease progression. Studies treating HIV-1-infected individuals with latency reactivation agents to reduce their latent HIV-1 reservoirs indicated that their HIV-1-specific immune responses were insufficient to effectively eliminate the reactivated latent HIV-1-infected T cells. Mobilization of ADCC may facilitate elimination of reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells to deplete the HIV-1 reservoir and contribute to a functional HIV-1 cure. The most effective antibodies for controlling and eradicating HIV-1 infection would likely have the dual capacities of potently neutralizing a broad range of HIV-1 isolates and effectively mobilizing HIV-1-specific ADCC to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells. For this purpose, we constructed LSEVh-LS-F, a broadly neutralizing, defucosylated hexavalent fusion protein specific for both the CD4 and coreceptor gp120-binding sites. LSEVh-LS-F potently inhibited in vivo HIV-1 and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in humanized mouse and macaque models, respectively, including in vivo neutralization of HIV-1 strains resistant to the broadly neutralizing antibodies VRC01 and 3BNC117. We developed a novel humanized mouse model to evaluate in vivo human NK cell-mediated elimination of HIV-1-infected cells by ADCC and utilized it to demonstrate that LSEVh-LS-F rapidly mobilized NK cells to eliminate >80% of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo 1 day after its administration. The capacity of LSEVh-LS-F to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells via ADCC combined with its broad neutralization activity supports its potential use as an immunotherapeutic agent to eliminate reactivated latent cells and deplete the HIV-1 reservoir.
   IMPORTANCE Mobilization of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells is a strategy which may contribute to depleting the HIV-1 reservoir and achieving a functional HIV-1 cure. To more effectively mobilize ADCC, we designed and constructed LSEVh-LS-F, a broadly neutralizing, defucosylated hexavalent fusion protein specific for both the CD4 and coreceptor gp120-binding sites. LSEVh-LS-F potently inhibited in vivo HIV-1 and SHIV infection in humanized mouse and macaque models, respectively, including in vivo neutralization of an HIV-1 strain resistant to the broadly neutralizing antibodies VRC01 and 3BNC117. Using a novel humanized mouse model, we demonstrated that LSEVh-LS-F rapidly mobilized NK cells to eliminate >80% of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo 1 day after its administration.

AB Influenza A virus (IAV) replication relies on an intricate interaction between virus and host cells. How the cellular proteins are usurped for IAV replication remains largely obscure. The aim of this study was to search for novel and potential cellular factors that participate in IAV replication. ZBTB25, a transcription repressor of a variety of cellular genes, was identified by an RNA interference (RNAi) genomic library screen. Depletion of ZBTB25 significantly reduced IAV production. Conversely, overexpression of ZBTB25 enhanced it. ZBTB25 interacted with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein and modulated its transcription activity. In addition, ZBTB25 also functioned as a viral RNA (vRNA)-binding protein, binding preferentially to the U-rich sequence within the 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of vRNA. Both protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions involving ZBTB25 facilitated viral RNA transcription and replication. In addition, ZBTB25 suppressed interferon production, further enhancing viral replication. ZBTB25-associated functions required an intact zinc finger domain and posttranslational SUMO-1 modification of ZBTB25. Furthermore, treatment with disulfiram (a zinc ejector) of ZBTB25-overexpressing cells showed significantly reduced IAV production as a result of reduced RNA synthesis. Our findings indicate that IAV usurps ZBTB25 for IAV RNA synthesis and serves as a novel and potential therapeutic antiviral target.
   IMPORTANCE IAV-induced seasonal influenza causes severe illness and death in high-risk populations. However, IAV has developed resistance to current antiviral drugs due to its high mutation rate. Therefore, development of drugs targeting cellular factors required for IAV replication is an attractive alternative for IAV therapy. Here, we discovered a cellular protein, ZBTB25, that enhances viral RdRp activity by binding to both viral RdRp and viral RNA to stimulate viral RNA synthesis. A unique feature of ZBTB25 in the regulation of viral replication is its dual transcription functions, namely, promoting viral RNA transcription through binding to the U-rich region of vRNA and suppressing cellular interferon production. ZBTB25 contains a zinc finger domain that is required for RNA-inhibitory activity by chelating zinc ions. Disulfiram treatment disrupts the zinc finger functions, effectively repressing IAV replication. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that ZBTB25 regulates IAV RNA transcription and replication and serves as a promising antiviral target for IAV treatment.

AB The neurotropic herpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV) establishes a lifelong latent infection in humans following primary infection. The low abundance of VZV nucleic acids in human neurons has hindered an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate viral gene transcription during latency. To overcome this critical barrier, we optimized a targeted capture protocol to enrich VZV DNA and cDNA prior to whole-genome/transcriptome sequence analysis. Since the VZV genome is remarkably stable, it was surprising to detect that VZV32, a VZV laboratory strain with no discernible growth defect in tissue culture, contained a 2,158-bp deletion in open reading frame (ORF) 12. Consequently, ORF 12 and 13 protein expression was abolished and Akt phosphorylation was inhibited. The discovery of the ORF 12 deletion, revealed through targeted genome sequencing analysis, points to the need to authenticate the VZV genome when the virus is propagated in tissue culture.
   IMPORTANCE Viruses isolated from clinical samples often undergo genetic modifications when cultured in the laboratory. Historically, VZV is among the most genetically stable herpesviruses, a notion supported by more than 60 complete genome sequences from multiple isolates and following multiple in vitro passages. However, application of enrichment protocols to targeted genome sequencing revealed the unexpected deletion of a significant portion of VZV ORF 12 following propagation in cultured human fibroblast cells. While the enrichment protocol did not introduce bias in either the virus genome or transcriptome, the findings indicate the need for authentication of VZV by sequencing when the virus is propagated in tissue culture.

AB Recent worldwide outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the lack of an approved vaccine raise serious concerns regarding preparedness to combat this emerging virus. We used a virus-like particle (VLP)-based approach to develop a vaccine and a microneutralization assay for ZIKV. A synthetic capsid-premembrane-envelope (C-prM- E) gene construct of ZIKV was used to generate reporter virus particles (RVPs) that package a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-expressing West Nile virus (WNV) replicon. The assay was adapted to a 96-well format, similar to the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and showed high reproducibility with specific detection of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, C-prM-E and prM-E VLPs were tested as vaccine candidates in mice and compared to DNA vaccination. While the ZIKV prM-E construct alone was sufficient for generating VLPs, efficient VLP production from the C-prM-E construct could be achieved in the presence of the WNV NS2B-3 protease, which cleaves C from prM, allowing virus release. Immunization studies in mice showed that VLPs generated higher neutralizing antibody titers than those with the DNA vaccines, with C-prM-E VLPs giving slightly higher titers than those with prM-E VLPs. The superiority of C-prM-E VLPs suggests that inclusion of capsid may have benefits for ZIKV and other flaviviral VLP vaccines. To facilitate the VLP platform, we generated a stable cell line expressing high levels of ZIKV prM-E proteins that constitutively produce VLPs as well as a cell line expressing ZIKV C-prM-E proteins for RVP production. While several vaccine platforms have been proposed for ZIKV, this study describes a safe, effective, and economical VLP-based vaccine against ZIKV.
   IMPORTANCE To address the growing Zika virus epidemic, we undertook this study with two objectives: first, to develop a safe, effective, and economical vaccine for ZIKV, and second, to develop a rapid and versatile assay to detect the anti-ZIKV immune response. We generated a cell line stably expressing ZIKV prM-E that produces large amounts of VLPs in the supernatant and a ZIKV C-prM-E cell line that produces reporter virus particles upon transfection with a GFP replicon plasmid. The prM-E VLPs induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in mice that was better when the capsid was included. VLP-based vaccines showed significantly better neutralizing antibody responses than those with their DNA counterparts. The RVP-based microneutralization assay worked similarly to the PRNT assay, with a rapid GFP readout in a 96-well format. Our VLP-based platform provides a source for a ZIKV vaccine and diagnosis that can rapidly be adapted to current outbreaks.

AB Untreated HIV-positive (HIV-1(+)) individuals frequently suffer from HIVassociated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), with about 30% of AIDS patients suffering severe HIV-associated dementias (HADs). Antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced the incidence of HAND and HAD. However, there is a continuing problem of milder neurocognitive impairments in treated HIV+ patients that may be increasing with long-term therapy. In the present study, we investigated whether envelope (env) genes could be amplified from proviral DNA or RNA derived from brain tissue of 12 individuals with normal neurology or minor neurological conditions (N/MC individuals). The tropism and characteristics of the brain-derived Envs were then investigated and compared to those of Envs derived from immune tissue. We showed that (i) macrophage-tropic R5 Envs could be detected in the brain tissue of 4/12 N/MC individuals, (ii) macrophage-tropic Envs in brain tissue formed compartmentalized clusters distinct from non-macrophage-tropic (non-mac-tropic) Envs recovered from the spleen or brain, (iii) the evidence was consistent with active viral expression by macrophage-tropic variants in the brain tissue of some individuals, and (iv) Envs from immune tissue of the N/MC individuals were nearly all tightly non-mac-tropic, contrasting with previous data for neuro-AIDS patients where immune tissue Envs mediated a range of macrophage infectivities, from background levels to modest infection, with a small number of Envs from some patients mediating high macrophage infection levels. In summary, the data presented here show that compartmentalized and active macrophage-tropic HIV-1 variants are present in the brain tissue of individuals before neurological disease becomes overt or serious.
   IMPORTANCE The detection of highly compartmentalized macrophage-tropic R5 Envs in the brain tissue of HIV patients without serious neurological disease is consistent with their emergence from a viral population already established there, perhaps from early disease. The detection of active macrophage-tropic virus expression, and probably replication, indicates that antiretroviral drugs with optimal penetration through the blood-brain barrier should be considered even for patients without neurological disease (neuro-disease). Finally, our data are consistent with the brain forming a sanctuary site for latent virus and low-level viral replication in the absence of neuro-disease.

AB The discovery that adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) encodes an eighth protein, called assembly-activating protein (AAP), transformed our understanding of wild-type AAV biology. Concurrently, it raised questions about the role of AAP during production of recombinant vectors based on natural or molecularly engineered AAV capsids. Here, we show that AAP is indeed essential for generation of functional recombinant AAV2 vectors in both mammalian and insect cell-based vector production systems. Surprisingly, we observed that AAV2 capsid proteins VP1 to -3 are unstable in the absence of AAP2, likely due to rapid proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase of intracellular VP1 to -3 but neither triggered assembly of functional capsids nor promoted nuclear localization of the capsid proteins. Together, this underscores the crucial and unique role of AAP in the AAV life cycle, where it rapidly chaperones capsid assembly, thus preventing degradation of free capsid proteins. An expanded analysis comprising nine alternative AAV serotypes (1, 3 to 9, and rh10) showed that vector production always depends on the presence of AAP, with the exceptions of AAV4 and AAV5, which exhibited AAP-independent, albeit low-level, particle assembly. Interestingly, AAPs from all 10 serotypes could cross-complement AAP-depleted helper plasmids during vector production, despite there being distinct intracellular AAP localization patterns. These were most pronounced for AAP4 and AAP5, congruent with their inability to rescue an AAV2/AAP2 knockout. We conclude that AAP is key for assembly of genuine capsids from at least 10 different AAV serotypes, which has implications for vectors derived from wild-type or synthetic AAV capsids.
   IMPORTANCE Assembly of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) is regulated by the assembly-activating protein (AAP), whose open reading frame overlaps with that of the viral capsid proteins. As the majority of evidence was obtained using virus-like particles composed solely of the major capsid protein VP3, AAP's role in and relevance for assembly of genuine AAV capsids have remained largely unclear. Thus, we established a trans-complementation assay permitting assessment of AAP functionality during production of recombinant vectors based on complete AAV capsids and derived from any serotype. We find that AAP is indeed a critical factor not only for AAV2, but also for generation of vectors derived from nine other AAV serotypes. Moreover, we identify a new role of AAP in maintaining capsid protein stability in mammalian and insect cells. Thereby, our study expands our current understanding of AAV/AAP biology, and it concomitantly provides insights into the importance of AAP for AAV vector production.

   RELEASE
AB Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of the Filoviridae family and the cause of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. The EBOV VP40 (eVP40) matrix protein is the main driving force for virion assembly and budding. Indeed, expression of eVP40 alone in mammalian cells results in the formation and budding of virus-like particles (VLPs) which mimic the budding process and morphology of authentic, infectious EBOV. To complete the budding process, eVP40 utilizes its PPXY L-domain motif to recruit a specific subset of host proteins containing one or more modular WW domains that then function to facilitate efficient production and release of eVP40 VLPs. In this report, we identified additional host WW-domain interactors by screening for potential interactions between mammalian proteins possessing one or more WW domains and WT or PPXY mutant peptides of eVP40. We identified the HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 and all four of its WW domains as strong interactors with the PPXY motif of eVP40. The eVP40-WWP1 interaction was confirmed by both peptide pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, which also demonstrated that modular WW domain 1 of WWP1 was most critical for binding to eVP40. Importantly, the eVP40-WWP1 interaction was found to be biologically relevant for VLP budding since (i) small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of endogenous WWP1 resulted in inhibition of eVP40 VLP egress, (ii) coexpression of WWP1 and eVP40 resulted in ubiquitination of eVP40 and a subsequent increase in eVP40 VLP egress, and (iii) an enzymatically inactive mutant of WWP1 (C890A) did not ubiquitinate eVP40 or enhance eVP40 VLP egress. Last, our data show that ubiquitination of eVP40 by WWP1 enhances egress of VLPs and concomitantly decreases cellular levels of higher-molecular- weight oligomers of eVP40. In sum, these findings contribute to our fundamental understanding of the functional interplay between host E3 ligases, ubiquitination, and regulation of EBOV VP40-mediated egress.
   IMPORTANCE Ebola virus (EBOV) is a high-priority, emerging human pathogen that can cause severe outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates. As there are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for EBOV, a better understanding of the biology and functions of EBOV-host interactions that promote or inhibit viral budding is warranted. Here, we describe a physical and functional interaction between EBOV VP40 (eVP40) and WWP1, a host E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates VP40 and regulates VLP egress. This viral PPXY-host WW domain-mediated interaction represents a potential new target for host-oriented inhibitors of EBOV egress.

AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes debilitating musculoskeletal pain and inflammation and can persist for months to years after acute infection. Although studies of humans and experimentally infected animals suggest that CHIKV infection persists in musculoskeletal tissues, the mechanisms for this remain poorly understood. To evaluate this further, we isolated CHIKV from the serum of persistently infected Rag1(-/-) mice at day 28. When inoculated into naive wild-type (WT) mice, this persistently circulating CHIKV strain displayed a capacity for earlier dissemination and greater pathogenicity than the parental virus. Sequence analysis revealed a nonsynonymous mutation in the E2 glycoprotein (E2 K200R) and a deletion within the 3 ' untranslated region (3 '-UTR). The introduction of these changes into the parental virus conferred enhanced virulence in mice, although primary tropism for musculoskeletal tissues was maintained. The E2 K200R mutation was largely responsible for enhanced viral dissemination and pathogenicity, although these effects were augmented by the 3 '-UTR deletion. Finally, studies with Irf3/Irf7(-/-) and Ifnar1(-/-) mice suggest that the E2 K200R mutation enhances viral dissemination from the site of inoculation independently of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-, IRF7-, and IFNAR1-mediated responses. As our findings reveal viral determinants of CHIKV dissemination and pathogenicity, their further study should help to elucidate host-virus interactions that determine acute and chronic CHIKV infection.
   IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a globally spreading, mosquito-transmitted virus that causes debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease in humans. The viral genetic determinants that dictate the severity of acute and chronic diseases are not understood. To improve our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis, we evaluated a CHIKV strain isolated from the serum of chronically infected immunocompromised mice. Sequence analysis of this persistent CHIKV strain identified two mutations, an amino acid change in the E2 viral attachment protein and a deletion within the 3 '-UTR of the viral genome. We identified roles for these mutations in the enhancement of viral dissemination from the inoculation site and in disease severity. These data improve our understanding of the viral determinants of CHIKV pathogenesis and adaptive changes that occur during viral persistence.

AB The arenavirus family consists of several highly pathogenic viruses, including the Old World (OW) arenavirus Lassa fever virus (LASV) and the New World (NW) Junin virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV). Host response to infection by these pathogenic arenaviruses is distinct in many aspects. JUNV and MACV infections readily induce an interferon (IFN) response in human cells, while LASV infection usually triggers an undetectable or weak IFN response. JUNV induces an IFN response through RIG-I, suggesting that the host non-self RNA sensor readily detects JUNV viral RNAs (vRNAs) during infection and activates IFN response. Double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR) is another host non-self RNA sensor classically known for its vRNA recognition activity. Here we report that infection with NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV, but not OW LASV, activated PKR, concomitant with elevated phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha). Host protein synthesis was substantially suppressed in MACV- and JUNV-infected cells but was only marginally reduced in LASV-infected cells. Despite the antiviral activity known for PKR against many other viruses, the replication of JUNV and MACV was not impaired but was slightly augmented in wild-type (wt) cells compared to that in PKR-deficient cells, suggesting that PKR or PKR activation did not negatively affect JUNV and MACV infection. Additionally, we found an enhanced IFN response in JUNV- or MACV-infected PKR-deficient cells, which was inversely correlated with virus replication.
   IMPORTANCE The detection of viral RNA by host non-self RNA sensors, including RIG-I and MDA5, is critical to the initiation of the innate immune response to RNA virus infection. Among pathogenic arenaviruses, the OW LASV usually does not elicit an interferon response. However, the NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV readily trigger an IFN response in a RIG-I-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV, but not the OW arenavirus LASV, activated the dsRNA-dependent PKR, another host non-self RNA sensor, during infection. Interestingly, the replication of JUNV and MACV was not restricted but was rather slightly augmented in the presence of PKR. Our data provide new evidence for a distinct interplay between host non-self RNA sensors and pathogenic arenaviruses, which also provides insights into the pathogenesis of arenaviruses and may facilitate the design of vaccines and treatments against arenavirus-caused diseases.

AB Avian influenza viruses of the H7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtype present a significant public health threat, as evidenced by the ongoing outbreak of human A(H7N9) infections in China. When evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays, H7 viruses and vaccines are found to induce lower level of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) than do their seasonal counterparts, making it difficult to develop and evaluate prepandemic vaccines. We have previously shown that purified recombinant H7 HA appear to be poorly immunogenic in that they induce low levels of HI and MN antibodies. In this study, we immunized mice with whole inactivated reverse genetics reassortant (RG) viruses expressing HA and neuraminidase (NA) from 3 different H7 viruses [A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9), A/Netherlands/219/2003(H7N7), and A/New York/107/2003(H7N2)] or with human A(H1N1) pdm09 (A/California/07/2009-like) or A(H3N2) (A/Perth16/2009) viruses. Mice produced equivalent titers of antibodies to all viruses as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the antibody titers induced by H7 viruses were significantly lower when measured by HI and MN assays. Despite inducing very low levels of nAb, H7 vaccines conferred complete protection against homologous virus challenge in mice, and the serum antibodies directed against the HA head region were capable of mediating protection. The apparently low immunogenicity associated with H7 viruses and vaccines may be at least partly related to measuring antibody titers with the traditional HI and MN assays, which may not provide a true measure of protective immunity associated with H7 immunization. This study underscores the need for development of additional correlates of protection for prepandemic vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE H7 avian influenza viruses present a serious risk to human health. Preparedness efforts include development of prepandemic vaccines. For seasonal influenza viruses, protection is correlated with antibody titers measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus microneutralization (MN) assays. Since H7 vaccines typically induce low titers in HI and MN assays, they have been considered to be poorly immunogenic. We show that in mice H7 whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIVs) were as immunogenic as seasonal WIVs, as they induced similar levels of overall serum antibodies. However, a larger fraction of the antibodies induced by H7 WIV was nonneutralizing in vitro. Nevertheless, the H7 WIV completely protected mice against homologous viral challenge, and antibodies directed against the HA head were the major contributor toward immune protection. Vaccines against H7 avian influenza viruses may be more effective than HI and virus neutralization assays suggest, and such vaccines may need other methods for evaluation.

AB Recombination events induce significant genetic changes, and this process can result in virus genetic diversity or in the generation of novel pathogenicity. We discovered a new recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) gag gene harboring an unrelated insertion, termed the X region, which was derived from Felis catus endogenous gammaretrovirus 4 (FcERV-gamma4). The identified FcERV-gamma4 proviruses have lost their coding capabilities, but some can express their viral RNA in feline tissues. Although the X-region-carrying recombinant FeLVs appeared to be replication-defective viruses, they were detected in 6.4% of tested FeLV-infected cats. All isolated recombinant FeLV clones commonly incorporated a middle part of the FcERV-gamma4 5 '-leader region as an X region. Surprisingly, a sequence corresponding to the portion contained in all X regions is also present in at least 13 endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) observed in the cat, human, primate, and pig genomes. We termed this shared genetic feature the commonly shared (CS) sequence. Despite our phylogenetic analysis indicating that all CS-sequence-carrying ERVs are classified as gammaretroviruses, no obvious closeness was revealed among these ERVs. However, the Shannon entropy in the CS sequence was lower than that in other parts of the provirus genome. Notably, the CS sequence of human endogenous retrovirus T had 73.8% similarity with that of FcERV-gamma4, and specific signals were detected in the human genome by Southern blot analysis using a probe for the FcERV-gamma4 CS sequence. Our results provide an interesting evolutionary history for CS-sequence circulation among several distinct ancestral viruses and a novel recombined virus over a prolonged period.
   IMPORTANCE Recombination among ERVs or modern viral genomes causes a rapid evolution of retroviruses, and this phenomenon can result in the serious situation of viral disease reemergence. We identified a novel recombinant FeLV gag gene that contains an unrelated sequence, termed the X region. This region originated from the 5 ' leader of FcERV-gamma4, a replication-incompetent feline ERV. Surprisingly, a sequence corresponding to the X region is also present in the 5 ' portion of other ERVs, including human endogenous retroviruses. Scattered copies of the ERVs carrying the unique genetic feature, here named the commonly shared (CS) sequence, were found in each host genome, suggesting that ancestral viruses may have captured and maintained the CS sequence. More recently, a novel recombinant FeLV hijacked the CS sequence from inactivated FcERV-gamma4 as the X region. Therefore, tracing the CS sequences can provide unique models for not only the modern reservoir of new recombinant viruses but also the genetic features shared among ancient retroviruses.

AB Autophagy plays important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It uses double-or multiple-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes to remove protein aggregates and damaged organelles from the cytoplasm for recycling. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy to enhance its own replication. Here we describe a procedure that combines membrane flotation and affinity chromatography for the purification of autophagosomes from cells that harbor an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The purified autophagosomes had double-or multiplemembrane structures with a diameter ranging from 200 nm to 600 nm. The analysis of proteins associated with HCV-induced autophagosomes by proteomics led to the identification of HCV nonstructural proteins as well as proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Notably, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and annexin A2, which are proteins associated with lipid rafts, were also identified. The association of lipid rafts with HCVinduced autophagosomes was confirmed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Their association with autophagosomes was also confirmed in HCV-infected cells. The association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes was specific to HCV, as it was not detected in autophagosomes induced by nutrient starvation. Further analysis indicated that the autophagosomes purified from HCV replicon cells could mediate HCV RNA replication in a lipid raftdependent manner, as the depletion of cholesterol, a major component of lipid rafts, from autophagosomes abolished HCV RNA replication. Our studies thus demonstrated that HCV could specifically induce the association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes for its RNA replication.
   IMPORTANCE HCV can cause severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is one of the most important human pathogens. Infection with HCV can lead to the reorganization of membrane structures in its host cells, including the induction of autophagosomes. In this study, we developed a procedure to purify HCV-induced autophagosomes and demonstrated that HCV could induce the localization of lipid rafts to autophagosomes to mediate its RNA replication. This finding provided important information for further understanding the life cycle of HCV and its interaction with the host cells.

TI Human Metapneumovirus M2-2 Protein Acts as a Negative Regulator of Alpha
   Interferon Production by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells

AB Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has the ability to inhibit Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-and TLR9-dependent alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). However, the inhibition mechanism remains largely unknown. To identify viral proteins responsible for this inhibition, we performed a screening of HMPV open reading frames (ORFs) for the ability to block TLR7/9dependent signaling reconstituted in HEK293T cells by transfection with myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), IKK alpha, and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). This screening demonstrated that the M2-2 protein was the most potent inhibitor of TLR7/9-dependent IFN-alpha induction. A recombinant HMPV in which the M2-2 ORF was silenced indeed induced greater IFN-alpha production by human pDCs than wild-type HMPV did. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed direct physical association of the M2-2 protein with the inhibitory domain (ID) of IRF7. As a natural consequence of this, transfection of IRF7 lacking the ID, a constitutively active mutant, resulted in activation of the IFN-alpha promoter even in the presence of M2-2. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays and split Renilla luciferase complementation assays revealed that M2-2 inhibited MyD88/TRAF6/IKK alpha-induced homodimerization of IRF7. In contrast, expression of the M2-2 protein did not result in inhibition of IPS-1-induced homodimerization and resultant activation of IRF7. This indicates that inhibition of MyD88/TRAF6/IKK alpha induced IRF7 homodimerization does not result from a steric effect of M2-2 binding. Instead, it was found that M2-2 inhibited MyD88/TRAF6/IKK alpha -induced phosphorylation of IRF7 on Ser477. These results suggest that M2-2 blocks TLR7/9-dependent IFN-alpha induction by preventing IRF7 homodimerization, possibly through its effects on the phosphorylation status of IRF7.
   IMPORTANCE The family Paramyxoviridae is divided into two subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. Members of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae have the ability to inhibit TLR7/9-dependent IFN-alpha production, and the underlying inhibition mechanism has been intensively studied. In contrast, little is known about how members of the subfamily Pneumovirinae regulate IFN-alpha production by pDCs. We identified the M2-2 protein of HMPV, a member of the subfamily Pneumovirinae, as a negative regulator of IFN-alpha production by pDCs and uncovered the underlying mechanism. This study explains in part why the M2-2 knockout recombinant HMPV is attenuated and further suggests that M2-2 is a potential target for HMPV therapy.

AB Inner tegument protein UL37 is conserved among all three subfamilies of herpesviruses. Studies of UL37 homologs from two alphaherpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), have suggested that UL37 plays an essential albeit poorly defined role in intracellular capsid trafficking. At the same time, HSV and PRV homologs cannot be swapped, which suggests that in addition to a conserved function, UL37 homologs also have divergent virus-specific functions. Accurate dissection of UL37 functions requires detailed maps in the form of atomic-resolution structures. Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the N-terminal half of UL37 (UL37N) from PRV. Here, we report the crystal structure of HSV-1 UL37N. Comparison of the two structures reveals that UL37 homologs differ in their overall shapes, distributions of surface charges, and locations of projecting loops. In contrast, the previously identified R2 surface region is structurally conserved. We propose that within the N-terminal half of UL37, functional conservation is centered within the R2 surface region, whereas divergent structural elements pinpoint regions mediating virus-specific functions and may engage different binding partners. Together, the two structures can now serve as templates for a structure-guided exploration of both conserved and virus-specific functions of UL37.
   IMPORTANCE The ability to move efficiently within host cell cytoplasm is essential for replication in all viruses. It is especially important in the neuroinvasive alphaherpesviruses, such as human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and veterinarian pseudorabies virus (PRV), that infect the peripheral nervous system and have to travel long distances along axons. Capsid movement in these viruses is controlled by capsid-associated tegument proteins, yet their specific roles have not yet been defined. Systematic exploration of the roles of tegument proteins in capsid trafficking requires detailed navigational charts in the form of their three-dimensional structures. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal half of a conserved tegument protein, UL37, from HSV-1. This structure, along with our previously reported structure of the UL37 homolog from PRV, provides a much needed 3-dimensional template for the dissection of both conserved and virus-specific functions of UL37 in intracellular capsid trafficking.

AB Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), belonging to the genus Tospovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, causes significant economic damage to several vegetables and ornamental plants worldwide. Similar to those of all other negative-strand RNA viruses, the nucleocapsid (N) protein plays very important roles in its viral life cycle. N proteins protect genomic RNAs by encapsidation and form a viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) with some RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Here we show the crystal structure of the N protein from TSWV. Protomers of TSWV N proteins consist of three parts: the N arm, C arm, and core domain. Unlike N proteins of other negative-strand RNA viruses, the TSWV N protein forms an asymmetric trimeric ring. To form the trimeric ring, the N and C arms of the N protein interact with the core domains of two adjacent N proteins. By solving the crystal structures of the TSWV N protein with nucleic acids, we showed that an inner cleft of the asymmetric trimeric ring is an RNA-binding site. These characteristics are similar to those of N proteins of other viruses of the family Bunyaviridae. Based on these observations, we discuss possibilities of a TSWV encapsidation model.
   IMPORTANCE Tospoviruses cause significant crop losses throughout the world. Particularly, TSWV has an extremely wide host range (>1,000 plant species, including dicots and monocots), and worldwide losses are estimated to be in excess of $1 billion annually. Despite such importance, no proteins of tospoviruses have been elucidated so far. Among TSWV-encoded proteins, the N protein is required for assembling the viral genomic RNA into the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP), which is involved in various steps of the life cycle of these viruses, such as RNA replication, virus particle formation, and cell-to-cell movement. This study revealed the structure of the N protein, with or without nucleic acids, of TSWV as the first virus of the genus Tospovirus, so it completed our view of the N proteins of the family Bunyaviridae.

AB The coevolution of myxoma virus (MYXV) and wild European rabbits in Australia and Europe is a paradigm for the evolution of a pathogen in a new host species. Genomic analyses have identified the mutations that have characterized this evolutionary process, but defining causal mutations in the pathways from virulence to attenuation and back to virulence has not been possible. Using reverse genetics, we examined the roles of six selected mutations found in Australian field isolates of MYXV that fall in known or potential virulence genes. Several of these mutations occurred in genes previously identified as virulence genes in whole-gene knockout studies. Strikingly, no single or double mutation among the mutations tested had an appreciable impact on virulence. This suggests either that virulence evolution was defined by amino acid changes other than those analyzed here or that combinations of multiple mutations, possibly involving epistatic interactions or noncoding sequences, have been critical in the ongoing evolution of MYXV virulence. In sum, our results show that single-gene knockout studies of a progenitor virus can have little power to predict the impact of individual mutations seen in the field. The genetic determinants responsible for this canonical case of virulence evolution remain to be determined.
   IMPORTANCE The species jump of myxoma virus (MYXV) from the South American tapeti to the European rabbit populations of Australia and Europe is a canonical example of host-pathogen coevolution. Detailed molecular studies have identified multiple genes in MYXV that are critical for virulence, and genome sequencing has revealed the evolutionary history of MYXV in Australia and Europe. However, it has not been possible to categorically identify the key mutations responsible for the attenuation of or reversion to virulence during this evolutionary process. Here we use reverse genetics to examine the role of mutations in viruses isolated early and late in the Australian radiation of MYXV. Surprisingly, none of the candidate mutations that we identified as likely having roles in attenuation proved to be important for virulence. This indicates that considerable caution is warranted when interpreting the possible role of individual mutations during virulence evolution.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency and its associated carcinogenesis are regulated by dynamic changes in DNA methylation of both virus and host genomes. We show here that the ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) gene, implicated in hydroxymethylation and active DNA demethylation, is a key regulator of EBV latency type DNA methylation patterning. EBV latency types are defined by DNA methylation patterns that restrict expression of viral latency genes. We show that TET2 mRNA and protein expression correlate with the highly demethylated EBV type III latency program permissive for expression of EBNA2, EBNA3s, and LMP transcripts. We show that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) depletion of TET2 results in a decrease in latency gene expression but can also trigger a switch to lytic gene expression. TET2 depletion results in the loss of hydroxymethylated cytosine and a corresponding increase in cytosine methylation at key regulatory regions on the viral and host genomes. This also corresponded to a loss of RBP-j kappa binding and decreased histone H3K4 trimethylation at these sites. Furthermore, we show that the TET2 gene itself is regulated in a fashion similar to that of the EBV genome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that the TET2 gene contains EBNA2-dependent RBP-j kappa and EBF1 binding sites and is subject to DNA methylation-associated transcriptional silencing similar to what is seen in EBV latency type III genomes. Finally, we provide evidence that TET2 colocalizes with EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-j kappa binding sites and can interact with EBNA2 by coimmunoprecipitation. Taken together, these findings indicate that TET2 gene transcripts are regulated similarly to EBV type III latency genes and that TET2 protein is a cofactor of EBNA2 and coregulator of the EBV type III latency program and DNA methylation state.
   IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency and carcinogenesis involve the selective epigenetic modification of viral and cellular genes. Here, we show that TET2, a cellular tumor suppressor involved in active DNA demethylation, plays a central role in regulating the DNA methylation state during EBV latency. TET2 is coordinately regulated and functionally interacts with the viral oncogene EBNA2. TET2 and EBNA2 function cooperatively to demethylate genes important for EBV-driven B-cell growth transformation.

AB Attenuated measles virus (MV) is one of the most effective and safe vaccines available, making it an attractive candidate vector for preventing other infectious diseases. Yet the great capacity of this vaccine still needs to be understood at the molecular level. MV vaccine strains have different type I interferon (IFN)inducing abilities that partially depend on the presence of 5= copy-back defective interfering genomes (DI-RNAs). DI-RNAs are pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) that activate innate immune signaling and shape the adaptive immune response. In this study, we characterized the DI-RNAs produced by various modified recombinant MVs (rMVs), including vaccine candidates, as well as wild-type MV. All tested rMVs produced 5= copy-back DI-RNAs that were different in length and nucleotide sequence but still respected the so-called "rule of six." We correlated the presence of DI-RNAs with a larger stimulation of the IFN- pathway and compared their immunostimulatory potentials. Importantly, we revealed that encapsidation of DI-RNA molecules within the MV nucleocapsid abolished their immunoactive properties. Furthermore, we identified specific interactions of DIRNAs with both RIG-I and LGP2 but not MDA5. Our results suggest that DI-RNAs produced by rMV vaccine candidates may indeed strengthen their efficiency by triggering RLR signaling.
   IMPORTANCE Having been administered to hundreds of millions of children, the live attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine is the safest and most widely used human vaccine, providing high protection with long-term memory. Additionally, recombinant MVs carrying heterologous antigens are promising vectors for new vaccines. The great capacity of this vaccine still needs to be elucidated at the molecular level. Here we document that recombinant MVs produce defective interfering genomes that have high immunostimulatory properties via their binding to RIG-I and LGP2 proteins, both of which are cytosolic nonself RNA sensors of innate immunity. Defective interfering genome production during viral replication should be considered of great importance due to the immunostimulatory properties of these genomes as intrinsic adjuvants produced by the vector that increase recognition by the innate immune system.

AB The pathogenesis of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is strongly linked to the viral regulatory proteins Tax1 and HBZ, whose opposing functions contribute to the clinical outcome of infection. Type I interferons alpha and beta (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) are key cytokines involved in innate immunity, and IFN-alpha, in combination with other antivirals, is extensively used in the treatment of HTLV-1 infection. The relationship between HTLV-1 and IFN signaling is unclear, and to date the effect of HBZ on this pathway has not been examined. Here we report that HBZ significantly enhances interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-induced IFN-alpha- and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activities and IFN-alpha production and can counteract the inhibitory effect of Tax1. In contrast to this, we show that HBZ and Tax1 cooperate to inhibit the induction of IFN-beta and ISRE promoters by IRF3 and IFN-beta production. In addition, we reveal that HBZ enhances ISRE activation by IFN-alpha. We further show that HBZ enhances IRF7 and suppresses IRF3 activation by TBK1 and IKK epsilon. We demonstrate that HBZ has no effect on virus-induced nuclear accumulation of IRF3, suggesting that it may inhibit IRF3 activity at a transcriptional level. We show that HBZ physically interacts with IRF7 and IKK epsilon but not with IRF3 or TBK1. Overall, our findings suggest that both HBZ and Tax1 are negative regulators of immediate early IFN-beta innate immune responses, while HBZ but not Tax1 positively regulates the induction of IFN-alpha and downstream IFN-alpha signaling.
   IMPORTANCE Type I interferons are powerful antiviral cytokines and are used extensively in the treatment of HTLV-1-induced adult T cell leukemia (ATL). To date, the relationship between HTLV-1 and the IFN pathway is poorly understood, and studies so far have focused on Tax1. Our study is unique in that it examined the effect of HBZ, alone or in combination with Tax1, on type I IFN signaling. This is important because HBZ is frequently the only viral protein expressed in infected cells, particularly at later stages of infection. A better understanding of the how HBZ regulates IFN signaling may lead to the development of therapeutics that can modify such responses and improve the clinical outcome for infected individuals.

AB Viruses manipulate the complex interferon and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) system in different ways. We have previously shown that HIV inhibits type I and III interferons in its key target cells but directly stimulates a subset of >20 ISGs in macrophages and dendritic cells, many of which are antiviral. Here, we examine the mechanism of induction of ISGs and show this occurs in two phases. The first phase was transient (0 to 24 h postinfection [hpi]), induced mainly by extracellular vesicles and one of its component proteins, HSP90 alpha, contained within the HIV inoculum. The second, dominant, and persistent phase (>48 hpi) was induced via newly transcribed HIV RNA and sensed via RIGI, as shown by the reduction in ISG expression after the knockdown of the RIGI adaptor, MAVS, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the inhibition of both the initiation and elongation of HIV transcription by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transcriptional silencing. We further define the induction pathway, showing sequential HIV RNA stimulation via Tat, RIGI, MAVS, IRF1, and IRF7, also identified by siRNA knockdown. IRF1 also plays a key role in the first phase. We also show that the ISGs IFIT1 to -3 inhibit HIV production, measured as extracellular infectious virus. All induced antiviral ISGs probably lead to restriction of HIV replication in macrophages, contributing to a persistent, noncytopathic infection, while the inhibition of interferon facilitates spread to adjacent cells. Both may influence the size of macrophage HIV reservoirs in vivo. Elucidating the mechanisms of ISG induction may help in devising immunotherapeutic strategies to limit the size of these reservoirs.
   IMPORTANCE HIV, like other viruses, manipulates the antiviral interferon and interferonstimulated gene (ISG) system to facilitate its initial infection and establishment of viral reservoirs. HIV specifically inhibits all type I and III interferons in its target cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. It also induces a subset of over 20 ISGs of differing compositions in each cell target. This occurs in two temporal phases in macrophages. Extracellular vesicles contained within the inoculum induce the first, transient phase of ISGs. Newly transcribed HIV RNA induce the second, dominant ISG phase, and here, the full induction pathway is defined. Therefore, HIV nucleic acids, which are potent inducers of interferon and ISGs, are initially concealed, and antiviral ISGs are not fully induced until replication is well established. These antiviral ISGs may contribute to persistent infection in macrophages and to the establishment of viral reservoirs in vivo.

AB Myeloblastosis-associated virus 2 (MAV-2) is a highly tumorigenic simple avian retrovirus. Chickens infected in ovo with MAV-2 develop tumors in the kidneys, lungs, and liver with a short latency, less than 8 weeks. Here we report the results of molecular analyses of MAV-2-induced liver tumors that fall into three classes: hepatic hemangiosarcomas (HHSs), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Comprehensive inverse PCR-based screening of 92 chicken liver tumors revealed that in ca. 86% of these tumors, MAV-2 provirus had integrated into one of four gene loci: HRAS, EGFR, MET, and RON. Insertionally mutated genes correlated with tumor type: HRAS was hit in HHSs, MET in ICCs, RON mostly in ICCs, and EGFR mostly in HCCs. The provirus insertions led to the overexpression of the affected genes and, in the case of EGFR and RON, also to the truncation of exons encoding the extracellular ligand-binding domains of these transmembrane receptors. The structures of truncated EGFR and RON closely mimic the structures of oncogenic variants of these genes frequently found in human tumors (EGFRvIII and sfRON).
   IMPORTANCE These data describe the mechanisms of oncogenesis induced in chickens by the MAV-2 retrovirus. They also show that molecular processes converting cellular regulatory genes to cancer genes may be remarkably similar in chickens and humans. We suggest that the MAV-2 retrovirus-based model can complement experiments performed using mouse models and provide data that could translate to human medicine.

AB Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an often-fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. PML results when oligodendrocytes within immunocompromised individuals are infected with the human JC virus (JCV). We have identified an oligodendrocyte precursor cell line, termed G144, that supports robust levels of JCV DNA replication, a central part of the JCV life cycle. In addition, we have determined that JC virus readily infects G144 cells. Furthermore, we have determined that JCV DNA replication in G144 cells is stimulated by myristoylated (i.e., constitutively active) Akt and reduced by the Akt-specific inhibitor MK2206. Thus, this oligodendrocyte-based model system will be useful for a number of purposes, such as studies of JCV infection, establishing key pathways needed for the regulation of JCV DNA replication, and identifying inhibitors of this process.
   IMPORTANCE The disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by the infection of particular brain cells, termed oligodendrocytes, by the JC virus. Studies of PML, however, have been hampered by the lack of an immortalized human cell line derived from oligodendrocytes. Here, we report that the G144 oligodendrocyte cell line supports both infection by JC virus and robust levels of JCV DNA replication. Moreover, we have established that the Akt pathway regulates JCV DNA replication and that JCV DNA replication can be inhibited by MK2206, a compound that is specific for Akt. These and related findings suggest that we have established a powerful oligodendrocyte-based model system for studies of JCVdependent PML.

AB The predominant types of dendritic cells (DC) in the skin and mucosa are Langerhans cells (LC) and interstitial dermal DC (iDDC). LC and iDDC process cutaneous antigens and migrate out of the skin and mucosa to the draining lymph nodes to present antigens to T and B cells. Because of the strategic location of LC and iDDC and the ability of these cells to capture and process pathogens, we hypothesized that they could be infected with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma [KS]-associated herpesvirus) and have an important role in the development of KS. We have previously shown that HHV-8 enters monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) through DC-SIGN, resulting in nonproductive infection. Here we show that LC and iDDC generated from pluripotent cord blood CD34(+) cell precursors support productive infection with HHV-8. Anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody (MAb) inhibited HHV-8 infection of iDDC, as shown by low expression levels of viral proteins and DNA. In contrast, blocking of both langerin and the receptor protein tyrosine kinase ephrin A2 was required to inhibit HHV-8 infection of LC. Infection with HHV-8 did not alter the cell surface expression of langerin on LC but downregulated the expression of DC-SIGN on iDDC, as we previously reported for MDDC. HHV-8-infected LC and iDDC had a reduced ability to stimulate allogeneic CD4(+) T cells in the mixed-lymphocyte reaction. These results indicate that HHV-8 can target both LC and iDDC for productive infection via different receptors and alter their function, supporting their potential role in HHV-8 pathogenesis and KS.
   IMPORTANCE Here we show that HHV-8, a DNA tumor virus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma, infects three types of dendritic cells: monocyte-derived dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and interstitial dermal dendritic cells. We show that different receptors are used by this virus to infect these cells. DC-SIGN is a major receptor for infection of both monocyte-derived dendritic cells and interstitial dermal dendritic cells, yet the virus fully replicates only in the latter. HHV-8 uses langerin and the ephrin A2 receptor to infect Langerhans cells, which support full HHV-8 lytic replication. This infection of Langerhans cells and interstitial dermal dendritic cells results in an impaired ability to stimulate CD4(+) helper T cell responses. Taken together, our data show that HHV-8 utilizes alternate receptors to differentially infect and replicate in these tissue-resident DC and support the hypothesis that these cells play an important role in HHV-8 infection and pathogenesis.

AB Adenovirus (Ad)-based immunization is a popular approach in vaccine development, and Ad-based vectors are renowned for their potential to induce strong CD8(+) T cell responses to the encoded transgene. Surprisingly, we previously found in the mouse Friend retrovirus (FV) model that Ad-based immunization did not induce CD8(+) T cell responses to the FV Leader-Gag-derived immunodominant epitope GagL(85-93). We show now that induction of GagL(85-93)-specific CD8(+) T cells was highly effective when leader-Gag was delivered by plasmid DNA immunization, implying a role for Ad-derived epitopes in mediating unresponsiveness. By immunizing with DNA constructs encoding strings of GagL(85-93) and the two Ad-derived epitopes DNA-binding protein(418-426) (DBP418-426) and hexon(486-494), we confirmed that Ad epitopes prevent induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, while DBP418-426 did not interfere with GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cell induction, the H-2D(d)-restricted hexon(486-494) suppressed the CD8(+) T cell response to the H-2D(b)-restricted GagL(85-93) strongly in H-2b/d mice but not in H-2(b/b) mice. This finding indicates that competition occurs at the level of responding CD8(+) T cells, and we could indeed demonstrate that coimmunization with an interleukin 2 (IL-2)-encoding plasmid restored GagL(85-93)-specific CD8(+) T cell responses to epitope strings in the presence of hexon(486-494). IL-2 codelivery did not restore GagL(85-93) responsiveness in Ad-based immunization, however, likely due to the presence of further epitopes in the Ad vector. Our findings show that seemingly immunodominant transgene epitopes can be dominated by Ad-derived epitopes. These findings underline the importance of thorough characterization of vaccine vectors, and modifications of vectors or immunogens may be required to prevent impaired transgene-specific immune responses.
   IMPORTANCE Ad-based vectors are widely used in experimental preclinical and clinical immunization studies against numerous infectious agents, such as human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, Plasmodium falciparum, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Preexisting immunity to Ad-based vectors is widely recognized as a hindrance to the widespread use of Ad-based vectors for immunizations in humans; however, our data show that an immune response to Ad-derived T cell epitopes can also result in loss or impairment of transgene-specific immune responses in prenaive vaccinees due to immune competition. Our results highlight that seemingly immunodominant epitopes may be affected by dominance of vector-derived epitopes, and modifications of the vector design or the immunogens employed in immunization may lead to more effective vaccines.

AB Reovirus particles are covered with 200 mu 1/sigma 3 heterohexamers. Following attachment to cell surface receptors, reovirus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the endosome, particles undergo a series of stepwise disassembly events. First, the sigma 3 protector protein is degraded by cellular proteases to generate infectious subviral particles (ISVPs). Second, the mu 1 protein rearranges into a protease-sensitive conformation to generate ISVP(star)s and releases two virus-encoded peptides, mu 1N and Phi. The released peptides promote delivery of the genome-containing core by perforating the endosomal membrane. Thus, to establish a productive infection, virions must be stable in the environment but flexible to disassemble in response to the appropriate cellular cue. The reovirus outer capsid is stabilized by mu 1 intratrimer, intertrimer, and trimer-core interactions. As a consequence of ISVP-to-ISVP star conversion, neighboring mu 1 trimers unwind and separate. Located within the mu 1 jelly roll beta barrel domain, which is a known regulator of ISVP star formation, residues 340 to 343 form a loop and have been proposed to facilitate viral entry. To test this idea, we generated recombinant reoviruses that encoded deletions within this loop (Delta 341 and Delta 342). Both deletions destabilized the outer capsid. Notably, Delta 342 impaired the viral life cycle; however, replicative fitness was restored by an additional change (V403A) within the mu 1 jelly roll beta barrel domain. In the Delta 341 and Delta 342 backgrounds, V403A also rescued defects in ISVP-to-ISVP star conversion. Together, these findings reveal a new region that regulates reovirus disassembly and how perturbing a metastable capsid can compromise replicative fitness.
   IMPORTANCE Capsids of nonenveloped viruses are composed of protein complexes that encapsulate, or form a shell around, nucleic acid. The protein-protein interactions that form this shell must be stable to protect the viral genome but also sufficiently flexible to disassemble during cell entry. Thus, capsids adopt conformations that undergo rapid disassembly in response to a specific cellular cue. In this work, we identify a new region within the mammalian orthoreovirus outer capsid that regulates particle stability. Amino acid deletions that destabilize this region impair the viral replication cycle. Nonetheless, replicative fitness is restored by a compensatory mutation that restores particle stability. Together, this work demonstrates the critical balance between assembling virions that are stable and maintaining conformational flexibility. Any factor that perturbs this balance has the potential to block a productive infection.

AB Baboons naturally infected with simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV) are a potentially useful model system for the study of vaccination against human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Here we expanded the number of available full-length baboon STLV-1 sequences from one to three and related the T cell responses that recognize the immunodominant Tax protein to the tax sequences present in two individual baboons. Continuously growing T cell lines were established from two baboons, animals 12141 and 12752. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of complete STLV genome sequences from these T cell lines revealed them to be closely related but distinct from each other and from the baboon STLV-1 sequence in the NCBI sequence database. Overlapping peptides corresponding to each unique Tax sequence and to the reference baboon Tax sequence were used to analyze recognition by T cells from each baboon using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Individual baboons expressed more gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to Tax peptides corresponding to their own STLV-1 sequence than in response to Tax peptides corresponding to the reference baboon STLV-1 sequence. Thus, our analyses revealed distinct but closely related STLV-1 genome sequences in two baboons, extremely low heterogeneity of STLV sequences within each baboon, no evidence for superinfection within each baboon, and a ready ability of T cells in each baboon to recognize circulating Tax sequences. While amino acid substitutions that result in escape from CD8(+) T cell recognition were not observed, premature stop codons were observed in 7% and 56% of tax sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from animals 12141 and 12752, respectively.
   IMPORTANCE It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 people suffer serious morbidity and 10,000 people die each year from the consequences associated with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection. There are no antiviral drugs and no preventive vaccine. A preventive vaccine would significantly impact the global burden associated with HTLV infections. Here we provide fundamental information on the simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV) naturally transmitted in a colony of captive baboons. The limited viral sequence heterogeneity in individual baboons, the identity of the viral gene product that is the major target of cellular immune responses, the persistence of viral amino acid sequences that are the major targets of cellular immune responses, and the emergence in vivo of truncated variants in the major target of cellular immune responses all parallel what are seen with HTLV infection of humans. These results justify the use of STLV-infected baboons as a model system for vaccine development efforts.

AB Persistent high-risk genus human Alphapapillomavirus (HPV) infections cause nearly every cervical carcinoma and a subset of tumors in the oropharyngeal tract. During the decades required for HPV-associated tumorigenesis, the cellular genome becomes significantly destabilized. Our analysis of cervical tumors from four separate data sets found a significant upregulation of the homologous-recombination (HR) pathway genes. The increased abundance of HR proteins can be replicated in primary cells by expression of the two HPV oncogenes (E6 and E7) required for HPV-associated transformation. HPV E6 and E7 also enhanced the ability of HR proteins to form repair foci, and yet both E6 and E7 reduce the ability of the HR pathway to complete double-strand break (DSB) repair by about 50%. The HPV oncogenes hinder HR by allowing the process to begin at points in the cell cycle when the lack of a sister chromatid to serve as a homologous template prevents completion of the repair. Further, HPV E6 attenuates repair by causing RAD51 to be mislocalized away from both transient and persistent DSBs, whereas HPV E7 is only capable of impairing RAD51 localization to transient lesions. Finally, we show that the inability to robustly repair DSBs causes some of these lesions to be more persistent, a phenotype that correlates with increased integration of episomal DNA. Together, these data support our hypothesis that HPV oncogenes contribute to the genomic instability observed in HPV-associated malignancies by attenuating the repair of damaged DNA.
   IMPORTANCE This study expands the understanding of HPV biology, establishing a direct role for both HPV E6 and E7 in the destabilization of the host genome by blocking the homologous repair of DSBs. To our knowledge, this is the first time that both viral oncogenes were shown to disrupt this DSB repair pathway. We show that HPV E6 and E7 allow HR to initiate at an inappropriate part of the cell cycle. The mislocalization of RAD51 away from DSBs in cells expressing HPV E6 and E7 hinders HR through a distinct mechanism. These observations have broad implications. The impairment of HR by HPV oncogenes may be targeted for treatment of HPV+ malignancies. Further, this attenuation of repair suggests HPV oncogenes may contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting the integration of the HPV genome, a common feature of HPV-transformed cells. Our data support this idea since HPV E6 stimulates the integration of episomes.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple human malignancies. EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is required for the efficient transformation of primary B lymphocytes in vitro and possibly in vivo. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a seminal role in cancer development. In some EBV-associated cancers, p53 tends to be wild type and overly expressed; however, the effects of p53 on LMP1 expression is not clear. We find LMP1 expression to be associated with p53 expression in EBV-transformed cells under physiological and DNA damaging conditions. DNA damage stimulates LMP1 expression, and p53 is required for the stimulation. Ectopic p53 stimulates endogenous LMP1 expression. Moreover, endogenous LMP1 blocks DNA damage-mediated apoptosis. Regarding the mechanism of p53-mediated LMP1 expression, we find that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), a direct target of p53, is associated with both p53 and LMP1. IRF5 binds to and activates a LMP1 promoter reporter construct. Ectopic IRF5 increases the expression of LMP1, while knockdown of IRF5 leads to reduction of LMP1. Furthermore, LMP1 blocks IRF5-mediated apoptosis in EBV-infected cells. All of the data suggest that cellular p53 stimulates viral LMP1 expression, and IRF5 may be one of the factors for p53-mediated LMP1 stimulation. LMP1 may subsequently block DNA damage-and IRF5-mediated apoptosis for the benefits of EBV. The mutual regulation between p53 and LMP1 may play an important role in EBV infection and latency and its related cancers.
   IMPORTANCE The tumor suppressor p53 is a critical cellular protein in response to various stresses and dictates cells for various responses, including apoptosis. This work suggests that an Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) principal viral oncogene is activated by cellular p53. The viral oncogene blocks p53-mediated adverse effects during viral infection and transformation. Therefore, the induction of the viral oncogene by p53 provides a means for the virus to cope with infection and DNA damage-mediated cellular stresses. This seems to be the first report that p53 activates a viral oncogene; therefore, the discovery would be interesting to a broad readership from the fields of oncology to virology.

AB The papillomavirus (PV) E2 protein is a DNA binding, protein interaction platform that recruits viral and host factors necessary for transcription and replication. We recently discovered phosphorylation of a tyrosine (Y102) in bovine PV (BPV) E2. To identify the responsible factor, we tested several candidate tyrosine kinases that are highly expressed in keratinocytes for binding to BPV-1 E2. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) coimmunoprecipitated with the BPV-1 E2 protein, as did human papillomavirus 31 (HPV-31) E2, which also colocalized with FGFR3 within the nucleus. A constitutively active mutant form of FGFR3 decreased BPV-1 and HPV-31 transient replication although this result also occurred in a BPV-1 E2 mutant lacking a previously identified phosphorylation site of interest (Y102). Furthermore, FGFR3 depletion in cell lines that maintain HPV-31 episomes increased viral copy number. These results suggest that FGFR3 kinase activity may regulate the PV reproductive program through phosphorylation of the E2 protein although this is unlikely to occur through the Y102 residue of HPV E2.
   IMPORTANCE The papillomavirus (PV) is a double-stranded DNA tumor virus infecting cervix, mouth, and throat tissues. The viral protein E2 is responsible for the replication of the virus. Understanding the mechanisms of the replicative life cycle of the virus may bring to light direct targets and treatments against viral infection. We recently found that the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) interacts with and mediates PV E2 function through phosphorylation of the E2 protein. Our study suggests that the function of the E2 protein may be regulated through a direct FGFR3 target during the maintenance stage of the PV life cycle.

AB Monomeric herpesvirus DNA is cleaved from concatemers and inserted into preformed capsids through the actions of the viral terminase. The terminase of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is composed of three subunits encoded by U(L)15, U(L)28, and U(L)33. The U(L)33-encoded protein (pU(L)33) interacts with pU(L)28, but its precise role in the DNA cleavage and packaging reaction is unclear. To investigate the function of pU(L)33, we generated a panel of recombinant viruses with either deletions or substitutions in the most conserved regions of U(L)33 using a bacterial artificial chromosome system. Deletion of 11 amino acids (residues 50 to 60 or residues 110 to 120) precluded viral replication, whereas the truncation of the last 10 amino acids from the pU(L)33 C terminus did not affect viral replication or the interaction of pU(L)33 with pU(L)28. Mutations that replaced the lysine at codon 110 and the arginine at codon 111 with alanine codons failed to replicate, and the pU(L)33 mutant interacted with pU(L)28 less efficiently. Interestingly, genomic termini of the large (L) and small (S) components were detected readily in cells infected with these mutants, indicating that concatemeric DNA was cleaved efficiently. However, the release of monomeric genomes as assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was greatly diminished, and DNA-containing capsids were not observed. These results suggest that pU(L)33 is necessary for one of the two viral DNA cleavage events required to release individual genomes from concatemeric viral DNA.
   IMPORTANCE This paper shows a role for pU(L)33 in one of the two DNA cleavage events required to release monomeric genomes from concatemeric viral DNA. This is the first time that such a phenotype has been observed and is the first identification of a function of this protein relevant to DNA packaging other than its interaction with other terminase components.

TI Adenovirus Core Protein VII Downregulates the DNA Damage Response on the

AB Viral manipulation of cellular proteins allows viruses to suppress host defenses and generate infectious progeny. Due to the linear double-stranded DNA nature of the adenovirus genome, the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is considered a barrier to successful infection. The adenovirus genome is packaged with protein VII, a virally encoded histone-like core protein that is suggested to protect incoming viral genomes from detection by the cellular DNA damage machinery. We showed that protein VII localizes to host chromatin during infection, leading us to hypothesize that protein VII may affect DNA damage responses on the cellular genome. Here we show that protein VII at cellular chromatin results in a significant decrease in accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma H2AX) following irradiation, indicating that protein VII inhibits DDR signaling. The oncoprotein SET was recently suggested to modulate the DDR by affecting access of repair proteins to chromatin. Since protein VII binds SET, we investigated a role for SET in DDR inhibition by protein VII. We show that knockdown of SET partially rescues the protein VII-induced decrease in gamma H2AX accumulation on the host genome, suggesting that SET is required for inhibition. Finally, we show that knockdown of SET also allows ATM to localize to incoming viral genomes bound by protein VII during infection with a mutant lacking early region E4. Together, our data suggest that the protein VII-SET interaction contributes to DDR evasion by adenovirus. Our results provide an additional example of a strategy used by adenovirus to abrogate the host DDR and show how viruses can modify cellular processes through manipulation of host chromatin.
   IMPORTANCE The DNA damage response (DDR) is a cellular network that is crucial for maintaining genome integrity. DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus challenge the resident genome and must overcome cellular responses, including the DDR. Adenoviruses are prevalent human pathogens that can cause a multitude of diseases, such as respiratory infections and conjunctivitis. Here we describe how a small adenovirus core protein that localizes to host chromatin during infection can globally downregulate the DDR. Our study focuses on key players in the damage signaling pathway and highlights how viral manipulation of chromatin may influence access of DDR proteins to the host genome.

TI Bam35 Tectivirus Intraviral Interaction Map Unveils New Function and

AB The family Tectiviridae comprises a group of tailless, icosahedral, membranecontaining bacteriophages that can be divided into two groups by their hosts, either Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. While the first group is composed of PRD1 and nearly identical well-characterized lytic viruses, the second one includes more variable temperate phages, like GIL16 or Bam35, whose hosts are Bacillus cereus and related Gram-positive bacteria. In the genome of Bam35, nearly half of the 32 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) have no homologs in databases (ORFans), being putative proteins of unknown function, which hinders the understanding of their biology. With the aim of increasing knowledge about the viral proteome, we carried out a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis of all the putative proteins encoded by the Bam35 genome. The resulting protein interactome comprised 76 unique interactions among 24 proteins, of which 12 have an unknown function. These results suggest that the P17 protein is the minor capsid protein of Bam35 and P24 is the penton protein, with the latter finding also being supported by iterative threading protein modeling. Moreover, the inner membrane transglycosylase protein P26 could have an additional structural role. We also detected interactions involving nonstructural proteins, such as the DNA-binding protein P1 and the genome terminal protein (P4), which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of recombinant proteins. Altogether, our results provide a functional view of the Bam35 viral proteome, with a focus on the composition and organization of the viral particle.
   IMPORTANCE Tailless viruses of the family Tectiviridae can infect commensal and pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, they have been proposed to be at the evolutionary origin of several groups of large eukaryotic DNA viruses and self-replicating plasmids. However, due to their ancient origin and complex diversity, many tectiviral proteins are ORFans of unknown function. Comprehensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of viral proteins can eventually disclose biological mechanisms and thus provide new insights into protein function unattainable by studying proteins one by one. Here we comprehensively describe intraviral PPIs among tectivirus Bam35 proteins determined using multivector yeast twohybrid screening, and these PPIs were further supported by the results of coimmunoprecipitation assays and protein structural models. This approach allowed us to propose new functions for known proteins and hypothesize about the biological role of the localization of some viral ORFan proteins within the viral particle that will be helpful for understanding the biology of tectiviruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria.

AB Strategies are needed to improve the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope (Env) antigens (Ag) for more long-lived, efficacious HIV-1 vaccine-induced B-cell responses. HIV-1 Env gp140 (native or uncleaved molecules) or gp120 monomeric proteins elicit relatively poor B-cell responses which are short-lived. We hypothesized that Env engagement of the CD4 receptor on T-helper cells results in anergic effects on T-cell recruitment and consequently a lack of strong, robust, and durable B-memory responses. To test this hypothesis, we occluded the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of gp140 by stable cross-linking with a 3-kDa CD4 miniprotein mimetic, serving to block ligation of gp140 on CD4(+) T cells while preserving CD4-inducible (CDi) neutralizing epitopes targeted by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector responses. Importantly, immunization of rhesus macaques consistently gave superior B-cell (P < 0.001) response kinetics and superior ADCC (P < 0.014) in a group receiving the CD4bs-occluded vaccine compared to those of animals immunized with gp140. Of the cytokines examined, Ag-specific interleukin-4 (IL-4) T-helper enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays of the CD4bs-occluded group increased earlier (P = 0.025) during the inductive phase. Importantly, CD4bs-occluded gp140 antigen induced superior B-cell and ADCC responses, and the elevated B-cell responses proved to be remarkably durable, lasting more than 60 weeks postimmunization.
   IMPORTANCE Attempts to develop HIV vaccines capable of inducing potent and durable B-cell responses have been unsuccessful until now. Antigen-specific B-cell development and affinity maturation occurs in germinal centers in lymphoid follicles through a critical interaction between B cells and T follicular helper cells. The HIV envelope binds the CD4 receptor on T cells as soluble shed antigen or as antigenantibody complexes, causing impairment in the activation of these specialized CD4positive T cells. We proposed that CD4-binding impairment is partly responsible for the relatively poor B-cell responses to HIV envelope-based vaccines. To test this hypothesis, we blocked the CD4 binding site of the envelope antigen and compared it to currently used unblocked envelope protein. We found superior and durable B-cell responses in macaques vaccinated with an occluded CD4 binding site on the HIV

AB In eukaryotic cells, the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins comprise the minimal machinery that triggers fusion of transport vesicles with their target membranes. Comparative studies revealed that genes encoding the components of the SNARE system are highly conserved in yeast, insect, and human genomes. Upon infection of insect cells by the virus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), the transcript levels of most SNARE genes initially were upregulated. We found that overexpression of dominant-negative (DN) forms of NSF or knockdown of the expression of NSF, the key regulator of the SNARE system, significantly affected infectious AcMNPV production. In cells expressing DN NSF, entering virions were trapped in the cytoplasm or transported to the nucleus with low efficiency. The presence of DN NSF also moderately reduced trafficking of the viral envelope glycoprotein GP64 to the plasma membrane but dramatically inhibited production of infectious budded virions (BV). Transmission electron microscopy analysis of infections in cells expressing DN NSF revealed that progeny nucleocapsids were retained in a perinuclear space surrounded by inner and outer nuclear membranes. Several baculovirus conserved (core) proteins (Ac76, Ac78, GP41, Ac93, and Ac103) that are important for infectious budded virion production were found to associate with NSF, and NSF was detected within the assembled BV. Together, these data indicate that the cellular SNARE system is involved in AcMNPV infection and that NSF is required for efficient entry and nuclear egress of budded virions of AcMNPV.
   IMPORTANCE Little is known regarding the complex interplay between cellular factors and baculoviruses during viral entry and egress. Here, we examined the cellular SNARE system, which mediates the fusion of vesicles in healthy cells, and its relation to baculovirus infection. Using a DN approach and RNA interference knockdown, we demonstrated that a general disruption of the SNARE machinery significantly inhibited the production of infectious BV of AcMNPV. The presence of a DN NSF protein resulted in low-efficiency entry of BV and the retention of progeny nucleocapsids in the perinuclear space during egress. Combined with these effects, we also found that several conserved (core) baculovirus proteins closely associate with NSF, and these results suggest their involvement in the egress of BV. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that the SNARE system is required for efficient entry of BV and nuclear egress of progeny nucleocapsids of baculoviruses.

AB and mediate intercellular communication. We found earlier that the conserved alphaherpesvirus US3 protein kinase induces long cell projections that contact distant cells and promote intercellular virus spread. In this report, we show that the US3-induced cell projections constitute TNTs. In addition, we report that US3-induced TNTs mediate intercellular transport of information (e.g., green fluorescent protein [GFP]) in the absence of other viral proteins. US3-induced TNTs are remarkably stable compared to most TNTs described in the literature. In line with this, US3-induced TNTs were found to contain stabilized (acetylated and detyrosinated) microtubules. Transmission electron microscopy showed that virus particles are individually transported in membrane-bound vesicles in US3-induced TNTs and are released along the TNT and at the contact area between a TNT and the adjacent cell. Contact between US3-induced TNTs and acceptor cells is very stable, which correlated with a marked enrichment in adherens junction components beta-catenin and E-cadherin at the contact area. These data provide new structural insights into US3-induced TNTs and how they may contribute to intercellular communication and alphaherpesvirus spread.
   IMPORTANCE Tunneling nanotubes (TNT) represent an important and yet still poorly understood mode of long-distance intercellular communication. We and others reported earlier that the conserved alphaherpesvirus US3 protein kinase induces long cellular protrusions in infected and transfected cells. Here, we show that US3-induced cell projections constitute TNTs, based on structural properties and transport of biomolecules. In addition, we report on different particular characteristics of US3-induced TNTs that help to explain their remarkable stability compared to physiological TNTs. In addition, transmission electron microscopy assays indicate that, in infected cells, virions travel in the US3-induced TNTs in membranous transport vesicles and leave the TNT via exocytosis. These data generate new fundamental insights into the biology of (US3-induced) TNTs and into how they may contribute to intercellular virus spread and communication.

AB HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been shown to occasionally display unusual virus neutralization profiles with nonsigmoidal slopes and plateaus at <100% neutralization against a variety of viruses. The significance of incomplete neutralization for the ability of bnAbs to mediate protective effects in vivo, however, is undetermined. In the current study, we selected two bnAbs, PGT121 and 3BNC117, as they incompletely neutralize the clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) stock (SHIV-327c) at 85% and 70%, respectively, and performed a protection study in rhesus macaques. The animals were intravenously (i.v.) administered PGT121 or 3BNC117 at 10 and 2 mg/kg of body weight before being rectally challenged with a single high dose of SHIV-327c. PGT121 protected 6 out of 7 monkeys, while 6 out of 7 3BNC117-pretreated animals became infected, although with significantly delayed plasma viremia compared to the control animals. These data suggest that complete neutralization is not imperative for bnAbs to prevent infection but that with increasing levels of incomplete neutralization the sterilizing activity diminishes.
   IMPORTANCE Multiple antibodies have been identified that potently neutralize a broad range of circulating HIV strains. However, not every virus-antibody combination results in complete neutralization of the input virus, suggesting that a fraction of virus particles are resistant to antibody neutralization despite high antibody concentrations. This observation of "incomplete neutralization" is associated with nonsigmoidal neutralization curves plateauing below 100% neutralization, but the significance of the phenomenon for the ability of neutralizing antibodies to mediate protective effects in vivo is undetermined. In this study, we show that the broadly neutralizing antibody PGT121, which neutralized only up to 85% of the SHIV-327c challenge stock in vitro, protected 6 out of 7 rhesus macaques against infection while the antibody 3BNC117, which neutralized up to 70% of SHIV-327c in vitro, did not prevent, though it significantly delayed, establishment of infection, suggesting that with increasing levels of incomplete neutralization the ability of a bnAb to mediate sterilizing protection diminishes.

AB Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) has recently been identified as a host restriction factor that exerts antiviral effects by catalyzing the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). CH25H can be rapidly induced upon infection with some viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, has ranked among the most important swine pathogens since it was discovered in the late 1980s. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated the expression of CH25H in cells by a so-far unknown mechanism, suggesting that CH25H exerts antiviral activity against PRRSV. Indeed, overexpression of CH25H inhibited PRRSV replication, whereas knockdown of CH25H by short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted PRRSV infection. The anti-PRRSV effect of 25HC operates via inhibition of viral penetration. Interestingly, a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) lacking hydroxylase activity still inhibited PRRSV infection. Screening using a yeast two-hybrid system followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence colocalization analyses confirmed that both CH25H and CH25H-M interact with the nonstructural protein 1 alpha (nsp1 alpha) of PRRSV. Unexpectedly, the expression of nsp1 alpha decreased following coexpression with CH25H or CH25H-M. Detailed analyses demonstrated that CH25H/CH25H-M could degrade nsp1 alpha through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that site K169 in the nsp1 alpha protein is the key site of ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CH25H restricts PRRSV replication by targeting viral penetration as well as degrading nsp1 alpha, revealing a novel antiviral mechanism used by CH25H.
   IMPORTANCE PRRSV has been a continuous threat to the global swine industry, and current vaccines are insufficient to provide sustainable control. CH25H has been found to exert a broad antiviral effect; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of anti-PRRSV drugs. Here, we demonstrate that CH25H is an interferonstimulated gene that is highly expressed in porcine alveolar macrophages. CH25H exerts its anti-PRRSV effect not only via the production of 25HC to inhibit viral penetration but also by degrading viral protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suggesting that CH25H is a candidate for the development of antiviral therapeutics. However, PRRSV infection appears to actively decrease CH25H expression to promote viral replication, highlighting the complex game between PRRSV and its host.

AB While the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L protein of rabies virus (RABV), a member of the genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae, has potential to be a therapeutic target for rabies, the molecular functions of this protein have remained largely unknown. In this study, to obtain a novel experimental tool for molecular function analysis of the RABV L protein, we established by using a reverse genetics approach an L gene-deficient RABV (Nishi-Delta L/Nluc), which infects, propagates, and correspondingly produces NanoLuc luciferase in cultured neuroblastoma cells transfected to express the L protein. trans-Complementation with wild-type L protein, but not that with a functionally defective L protein mutant, efficiently supported luciferase production by Nishi-Delta L/Nluc, confirming its potential for function analysis of the L protein. Based on the findings obtained from comprehensive genetic analyses of L genes from various RABV and other lyssavirus species, we examined the functional importance of a highly conserved L protein region at positions 1914 to 1933 by a trans-complementation assay with Nishi Delta L/Nluc and a series of L protein mutants. The results revealed that the amino acid sequence at positions 1929 to 1933 (NPYNE) is functionally important, and this was supported by other findings that this sequence is critical for binding of the L protein with its essential cofactor, P protein, and thus also for L protein's RNA polymerase activity. Our findings provide useful information for the development of an anti-RABV drug targeting the L-P protein interaction.
   IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the establishment of an L gene-deficient, reporter gene-expressing virus in all species of the order Mononegavirales, also highlighting its applicability to a trans-complementation assay, which is useful for molecular function analyses of their L proteins. Moreover, this study revealed for the first time that the NPYNE sequence at positions 1929 to 1933 in the RABV L protein is important for L protein's interaction with the P protein, consistent with and extending the results of a previous study showing that the P protein-binding domain in the L protein is located in its C-terminal region, at positions 1562 to 2127. This study indicates that the NPYNE sequence is a promising target for the development of an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis, which has high potential as a therapeutic drug for rabies.

AB Classically, natural killer (NK) cells have been defined by nonspecific innate killing of virus-infected and tumor cells. However, burgeoning evidence suggests that the functional repertoire of NK cells is far more diverse than has been previously appreciated, thus raising the possibility that there may be unexpected functional specialization and even adaptive capabilities among NK cell subpopulations. Some of the first evidence that NK cells respond in an antigen-specific fashion came from experiments revealing that subpopulations of murine NK cells were able to respond to a specific murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein and that in the absence of T and B cells, murine NK cells also mediated adaptive immune responses to a secondary challenge with specific haptens. These data have been followed by demonstrations of NK cell memory of viruses and viral antigens in mice and primates. Herein, we discuss different forms of NK cell antigen specificity and how these responses may be tuned to specific viral pathogens, and we provide assessment of the current literature that may explain molecular mechanisms of the novel phenomenon of NK cell memory.

TI Genetic Stability of Parainfluenza Virus 5-Vectored Human Respiratory

AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading etiologic agent of lower respiratory tract infections in children, but no licensed vaccine exists. Previously, we developed two parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based RSV vaccine candidates that protect mice against RSV challenge. PIV5 was engineered to express either the RSV fusion protein (F) or the RSV major attachment glycoprotein (G) between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) genes of the PIV5 genome [PIV5-RSV-F (HN-L) and PIV5-RSV-G (HN-L), respectively]. To investigate the stability of the vaccine candidates in vitro, they were passaged in Vero cells at high and low multiplicities of infection (MOIs) for 11 generations and the genome sequences, growth kinetics, and protein expression of the resulting viruses were compared with those of the parent viruses. Sporadic mutations were detected in the consensus sequences of the viruses after high-MOI passages, and mutation rates increased under low-MOI-passage conditions. None of the mutations abolished antigen expression. Increased numbers of mutations correlated with increased growth rates in vitro, indicating that the viruses evolved through the course of serial passages. We also examined the in vivo stability of the vaccine candidates after a single passage in African green monkeys. No mutations were detected in the consensus sequences of viruses collected from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of the animals. In vivo, mutations in RSV G and PIV5 L were found in individual isolates of PIV5-RSV-G (HN-L), but plaque isolates of PIV5-RSV-F (HN-L) had no mutations. To improve upon the PIV5-RSV-F (HN-L) candidate, additional vaccine candidates were generated in which the gene for RSV F was inserted into earlier positions in the PIV5 genome. These insertions did not negatively impact the sequence stability of the vaccine candidates. The results suggest that the RSV F and G gene insertions are stable in the PIV5 genome. However, the function of the foreign gene insertion may need to be considered when designing PIV5-based vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE The genetic stability of live viral vaccines is important for safety and efficacy. PIV5 is a promising live viral vector and has been used to develop vaccines. In this work, we examined the genetic stability of a PIV5-based RSV vaccine in vitro and in vivo. We found that insertions of foreign genes, such as the RSV F and G genes, were stably maintained in the PIV5 genome and there was no mutation that abolished the expression of RSV F or G. Interestingly, the function of the inserted gene may have an impact on PIV5 genome stability.

TI Structure-Based Design of Hepatitis C Virus Vaccines That Elicit

   SOFTWARE; COMPLEX
AB Despite recent advances in therapeutic options, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a severe global disease burden, and a vaccine can substantially reduce its incidence. Due to its extremely high sequence variability, HCV can readily escape the immune response; thus, an effective vaccine must target conserved, functionally important epitopes. Using the structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody in complex with a conserved linear epitope from the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (residues 412 to 423; epitope I), we performed structure-based design of immunogens to induce antibody responses to this epitope. This resulted in epitope-based immunogens based on a cyclic defensin protein, as well as a bivalent immunogen with two copies of the epitope on the E2 surface. We solved the X-ray structure of a cyclic immunogen in complex with the HCV1 antibody and confirmed preservation of the epitope conformation and the HCV1 interface. Mice vaccinated with our designed immunogens produced robust antibody responses to epitope I, and their serum could neutralize HCV. Notably, the cyclic designs induced greater epitope-specific responses and neutralization than the native peptide epitope. Beyond successfully designing several novel HCV immunogens, this study demonstrates the principle that neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies can be induced by epitope-based, engineered vaccines and provides the basis for further efforts in structure-based design of HCV vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver disease and liver cancer, with approximately 3% of the world's population infected. To combat this virus, an effective vaccine would have distinct advantages over current therapeutic options, yet experimental vaccines have not been successful to date, due in part to the virus's high sequence variability leading to immune escape. In this study, we rationally designed several vaccine immunogens based on the structure of a conserved epitope that is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies. In vivo results in mice indicated that these antigens elicited epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies, with various degrees of potency and breadth. These promising results suggest that a rational design approach can be used to generate an effective vaccine for this virus.

AB In the human hepatoma cell line Huh7, the coexpression of the coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein binding protein (CBP), steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1), and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) only modestly increase hepatitis B virus (HBV) biosynthesis. However, by utilizing the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, it was possible to demonstrate that PGC1 alpha alone can support viral biosynthesis independently of the expression of additional coactivators or transcription factors. In contrast, additional coactivators failed to support robust HBV replication in the absence of PGC1 alpha. These observations indicate that PGC1 alpha represents a novel adaptor molecule capable of recruiting the necessary transcriptional machinery to the HBV nucleocapsid promoter to modestly enhance viral pregenomic 3.5-kb RNA synthesis. Although this change in transcription is associated with a similar modest change in hepatitis B virus core antigen polypeptide (HBcAg/p21) synthesis, it mediates a dramatic increase in viral capsid production and robust viral replication. Therefore, it is apparent that the synthesis of cytoplasmic HBcAg/p21 above a critical threshold level is required for the efficient assembly of HBV replication-competent viral capsids.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major human pathogen, and novel targets for the development of additional therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that the coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) serves as a unique adaptor molecule for the recruitment of additional coactivator proteins, which can finely regulate HBV transcription. The consequence of this precise regulation of viral RNA levels by PGC1 alpha is a subtle increase in cytoplasmic HBcAg/p21 polypeptide translation, which shifts the equilibrium from dimer formation dramatically in favor of viral capsid assembly. These findings suggest that both PGC1 alpha and capsid assembly may represent attractive targets for the development of antiviral agents against chronic HBV infection.

   DESIGN
AB Evaluation of the epitope specificities, locations (systemic or mucosal), and effector functions of antibodies elicited by novel HIV-1 immunogens engineered to improve exposure of specific epitopes is critical for HIV-1 vaccine development. Utilizing an array of humoral assays, we evaluated the magnitudes, epitope specificities, avidities, and functions of systemic and mucosal immune responses elicited by a vaccine regimen containing Env cross-linked to a CD4-mimetic miniprotein (gp140-M64U1) in rhesus macaques. Cross-linking of gp140 Env to M64U1 resulted in earlier increases of both the magnitude and avidity of the IgG binding response than those with Env protein alone. Notably, IgG binding responses at an early time point correlated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function at the peak immunity time point, which was higher for the cross-linked Env group than for the Env group. In addition, the cross-linked Env group developed higher IgG responses against a linear epitope in the gp120 C1 region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. These data demonstrate that structural modification of the HIV-1 envelope immunogen by cross-linking of gp140 with the CD4-mimetic M64U1 elicited an earlier increase of binding antibody responses and altered the specificity of the IgG responses, correlating with the rise of subsequent antibody-mediated antiviral functions.
   IMPORTANCE The development of an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine remains a global priority to prevent new cases of HIV-1 infection. Of the six HIV-1 efficacy trials to date, only one has demonstrated partial efficacy, and immune correlate analysis of that trial revealed a role for binding antibodies and antibody Fc-mediated effector functions. New HIV-1 envelope immunogens are being engineered to selectively expose the most vulnerable and conserved sites on the HIV-1 envelope, with the goal of eliciting antiviral antibodies. Evaluation of the humoral responses elicited by these novel immunogen designs in nonhuman primates is critical for understanding how to improve upon immunogen design to inform further testing in human clinical trials. Our results demonstrate that structural modifications of Env that aim to mimic the CD4-bound conformation can result in earlier antibody elicitation, altered epitope specificity, and increased antiviral function postimmunization.

TI Isolation and Characterization of Metallosphaera Turreted Icosahedral

AB Our understanding of archaeal virus diversity and structure is just beginning to emerge. Here we describe a new archaeal virus, tentatively named Metallosphaera turreted icosahedral virus (MTIV), that was isolated from an acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Two strains of the virus were identified and were found to replicate in an archaeal host species closely related to Metallosphaera yellowstonensis. Each strain encodes a 9.8-to 9.9-kb linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with large inverted terminal repeats. Each genome encodes 21 open reading frames (ORFs). The ORFs display high homology between the strains, but they are quite distinct from other known viral genes. The 70-nm-diameter virion is built on a T = 28 icosahedral lattice. Both single particle cryoelectron microscopy and cryotomography reconstructions reveal an unusual structure that has 42 turret-like projections: 12 pentameric turrets positioned on the icosahedral 5-fold axes and 30 turrets with apparent hexameric symmetry positioned on the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Both the virion structural properties and the genome content support MTIV as the founding member of a new family of archaeal viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Many archaeal viruses are quite different from viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes. Initial characterization of MTIV reveals a virus distinct from other known bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal viruses; this finding suggests that viruses infecting Archaea are still an understudied group. As the first known virus infecting a Metallosphaera sp., MTIV provides a new system for exploring archaeal virology by examining host-virus interactions and the unique features of MTIV structure-function relationships. These studies will likely expand our understanding of virus ecology and evolution.

AB HIV-1 entry into target cells influences several aspects of HIV-1 pathogenesis, including viral tropism, HIV-1 transmission and disease progression, and response to entry inhibitors. The evolution from CCR5- to CXCR4-using strains in a given human host is still unpredictable. Here we analyzed timing and predictors for coreceptor evolution among recently HIV-1-infected individuals. Proviral DNA was longitudinally evaluated in 66 individuals using Geno2pheno[coreceptor]. Demographics, viral load, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell counts, CCR5.32 polymorphisms, GB virus C (GBV-C) coinfection, and HLA profiles were also evaluated. Ultradeep sequencing was performed on initial samples from 11 selected individuals. A tropism switch from CCR5-to CXCR4-using strains was identified in 9/49 (18.4%) individuals. Only a low baseline false-positive rate (FPR) was found to be a significant tropism switch predictor. No minor CXCR4-using variants were identified in initial samples of 4 of 5 R5/non-R5 switchers. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with an FPR of similar to 40.6% at baseline presented a stable FPR over time whereas lower FPRs tend to progressively decay, leading to emergence of CXCR4-using strains, with a mean evolution time of 27.29 months (range, 8.90 to 64.62). An FPR threshold above 40.6% determined by logistic regression analysis may make it unnecessary to further determine tropism for prediction of disease progression related to emergence of X4 strains or use of CCR5 antagonists. The detection of variants with intermediate FPRs and progressive FPR decay over time not only strengthens the power of Geno2pheno in predicting HIV tropism but also indirectly confirms a continuous evolution from earlier R5 variants toward CXCR4-using strains.
   IMPORTANCE The introduction of CCR5 antagonists in the antiretroviral arsenal has sparked interest in coreceptors utilized by HIV-1. Despite concentrated efforts, viral and human host features predicting tropism switch are still poorly understood. Limited longitudinal data are available to assess the influence that these factors have on predicting tropism switch and disease progression. The present study describes longitudinal tropism evolution in a group of recently HIV-infected individuals to determine the prevalence and potential correlates of tropism switch. We demonstrated here that a low baseline FPR determined by the Geno2pheno[coreceptor] algorithm can predict tropism evolution from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor use.

AB The recent approval of oncolytic virus for therapy of melanoma patients has increased the need for precise evaluation of the mechanisms by which oncolytic viruses affect tumor growth. Here we show that the human NK cell-activating receptor NKp46 and the orthologous mouse protein NCR1 recognize the reovirus sigma1 protein in a sialic-acid-dependent manner. We identify sites of NKp46/NCR1 binding to sigma1 and show that sigma1 binding by NKp46/NCR1 leads to NK cell activation in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that NCR1 activation is essential for reovirus-based therapy in vivo. Collectively, we have identified sigma1 as a novel ligand for NKp46/ NCR1 and demonstrated that NKp46/NCR1 is needed both for clearance of reovirus infection and for reovirus-based tumor therapy.
   IMPORTANCE Reovirus infects much of the population during childhood, causing mild disease, and hence is considered to be efficiently controlled by the immune system. Reovirus also specifically infects tumor cells, leading to tumor death, and is currently being tested in human clinical trials for cancer therapy. The mechanisms by which our immune system controls reovirus infection and tumor killing are not well understood. We report here that natural killer (NK) cells recognize a viral protein named sigma1 through the NK cell-activating receptor NKp46. Using several mouse tumor models, we demonstrate the importance of NK cells in protection from reovirus infection and in reovirus killing of tumors in vivo. Collectively, we identify a new ligand for the NKp46 receptor and provide evidence for the importance of NKp46 in the control of reovirus infections and in reovirus-based cancer therapy.

AB The switch of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from latency to lytic replication is a key event for viral dissemination and pathogenesis. MLN4924, a novel neddylation inhibitor, reportedly causes the onset of KSHV reactivation but impairs later phases of the viral lytic program in infected cells. Thus far, the molecular mechanism involved in the modulation of the KSHV lytic cycle by MLN4924 is not yet fully understood. Here, we confirmed that treatment of different KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines with MLN4924 substantially induces viral lytic protein expression. Due to the key role of the virally encoded ORF50 protein in the latent-to-lytic switch, we investigated its transcriptional regulation by MLN4924. We found that MLN4924 activates the ORF50 promoter (ORF50p) in KSHV-positive cells (but not in KSHV-negative cells), and the RBP-J kappa-binding elements within the promoter are critically required for MLN4924 responsiveness. In KSHV-negative cells, reactivation of the ORF50 promoter by MLN4924 requires the presence of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Under such a condition, LANA acts as a repressor to block the ORF50p activity, whereas MLN4924 treatment relieves LANA-mediated repression. Importantly, we showed that LANA is a neddylated protein and can be deneddylated by MLN4924. On the other hand, we revealed that MLN4924 exhibits concentration-dependent biphasic effects on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-or sodium butyrate (SB)-induced viral reactivation in PEL cell lines. In other words, low concentrations of MLN4924 promote activation of TPA-or SB-mediated viral reactivation, whereas high concentrations of MLN4924, conversely, inhibit the progression of TPA- or SB-mediated viral lytic program.
   IMPORTANCE MLN4924 is a neddylation (NEDD8 modification) inhibitor, which currently acts as an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. Although MLN4924 has been reported to trigger KSHV reactivation, many aspects regarding the action of MLN4924 in regulating the KSHV lytic cycle are not fully understood. Since the KSHV ORF50 protein is the key regulator of viral lytic reactivation, we focus on its transcriptional regulation by MLN4924. We here show that activation of the ORF50 gene by MLN4924 involves the relief of LANA-mediated transcriptional repression. Importantly, we find that LANA is a neddylated protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that neddylation occurs in viral proteins. Additionally, we provide evidence that different concentrations of MLN4924 have opposite effects on TPA-mediated or SB-mediated KSHV lytic cycle activation. Therefore, in clinical application, we propose that MLN4924 needs to be used with caution in combination therapy to treat KSHV-positive subjects.

AB Manipulation of host cellular pathways is a strategy employed by gammaherpesviruses, including mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), in order to negotiate a chronic infection. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays a unique yet incompletely understood role in gammaherpesvirus infection, as it has both proviral and antiviral effects. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection is poorly controlled in a host with global ATM insufficiency, whether the host is a mouse or a human. In contrast, ATM facilitates replication, reactivation, and latency establishment of several gammaherpesviruses in vitro, suggesting that ATM is proviral in the context of infected cell cultures. The proviral role of ATM is also evident in vivo, as myeloidspecific ATM expression facilitates MHV68 reactivation during the establishment of viral latency. In order to better understand the complex relationship between host ATM and gammaherpesvirus infection, we depleted ATM specifically in B cells, a cell type critical for chronic gammaherpesvirus infection. B cell-specific ATM deficiency attenuated the establishment of viral latency due to compromised differentiation of ATM-deficient B cells. Further, we found that during long-term infection, peritoneal B-1b, but not related B-1a, B cells display the highest frequency of gammaherpesvirus infection. While ATM expression did not affect gammaherpesvirus tropism for B-1 B cells, B cell-specific ATM expression was necessary to support viral reactivation from peritoneal cells during long-term infection. Thus, our study reveals a role of ATM as a host factor that promotes chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of B cells.
   IMPORTANCE Gammaherpesviruses infect a majority of the human population and are associated with cancer, including B cell lymphomas. ATM is a unique host kinase that has both proviral and antiviral roles in the context of gammaherpesvirus infection. Further, there is insufficient understanding of the interplay of these roles in vivo during chronic infection. In this study, we show that ATM expression by splenic B cells is required for efficient establishment of gammaherpesvirus latency. We also show that ATM expression by peritoneal B cells is required to facilitate viral reactivation during long-term infection. Thus, our study defines a proviral role of B cellspecific ATM expression during chronic gammaherpesvirus infection.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a stable latent infection that can persist for the life of the host. EBNA1 is required for the replication, maintenance, and segregation of the latent episome, but the structural features of EBNA1 that confer each of these functions are not completely understood. Here, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of an EBNA1 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and discovered a novel hexameric ring oligomeric form. The oligomeric interface pivoted around residue T585 as a joint that links and stabilizes higher-order EBNA1 complexes. Substitution mutations around the interface destabilized higher-order complex formation and altered the cooperative DNA-binding properties of EBNA1. Mutations had both positive and negative effects on EBNA1-dependent DNA replication and episome maintenance with OriP. We found that one naturally occurring polymorphism in the oligomer interface (T585P) had greater cooperative DNA binding in vitro, minor defects in DNA replication, and pronounced defects in episome maintenance. The T585P mutant was compromised for binding to OriP in vivo as well as for assembling the origin recognition complex subunit 2 (ORC2) and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at OriP. The T585P mutant was also compromised for forming stable subnuclear foci in living cells. These findings reveal a novel oligomeric structure of EBNA1 with an interface subject to naturally occurring polymorphisms that modulate EBNA1 functional properties. We propose that EBNA1 dimers can assemble into higher-order oligomeric structures important for diverse functions of EBNA1.
   IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus is a human gammaherpesvirus that is causally associated with various cancers. Carcinogenic properties are linked to the ability of the virus to persist in the latent form for the lifetime of the host. EBNA1 is a sequencespecific DNA-binding protein that is consistently expressed in EBV tumors and is the only viral protein required to maintain the viral episome during latency. The structural and biochemical mechanisms by which EBNA1 allows the long-term persistence of the EBV genome are currently unclear. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of an EBNA1 hexameric ring and characterized key residues in the interface required for higher-order complex formation and long-term plasmid maintenance.

TI The Translesion Polymerase Pol eta Is Required for Efficient
   Epstein-Barr Virus Infectivity and Is Regulated by the Viral

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and lytic replication are known to induce a cellular DNA damage response. We previously showed that the virally encoded BPLF1 protein interacts with and regulates several members of the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, a DNA damage tolerance pathway, and that these cellular factors enhance viral infectivity. BPLF1 is a late lytic cycle gene, but the protein is also packaged in the viral tegument, indicating that BPLF1 may function both early and late during infection. The BPLF1 protein expresses deubiquitinating activity that is strictly conserved across the Herpesviridae; mutation of the active site cysteine results in a loss of enzymatic activity. Infection with an EBV BPLF1 knockout virus results in decreased EBV infectivity. Polymerase eta (Pol eta), a specialized DNA repair polymerase, functions in TLS and allows for DNA replication complexes to bypass lesions in DNA. Here we report that BPLF1 interacts with Pol eta and that Pol eta protein levels are increased in the presence of functional BPLF1. BPLF1 promotes a nuclear relocalization of Pol eta molecules which are focus-like in appearance, consistent with the localization observed when Pol eta is recruited to sites of DNA damage. Knockdown of Pol eta resulted in decreased production of infectious virus, and further, Pol eta was found to bind to EBV DNA, suggesting that it may allow for bypass of damaged viral DNA during its replication. The results suggest a mechanism by which EBV recruits cellular repair factors, such as Pol eta, to sites of viral DNA damage via BPLF1, thereby allowing for efficient viral DNA replication.
   IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr virus is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and infects approximately 90% of the world's population. It causes lymphomas in individuals with acquired and innate immune disorders and is strongly associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and lymphomas that develop in organ transplant recipients. Cellular DNA damage is a major determinant in the establishment of oncogenic processes and is well studied, but there are few studies of endogenous repair of viral DNA. This work evaluates how EBV's BPLF1 protein and its conserved deu-biquitinating activity regulate the cellular DNA repair enzyme polymerase eta and recruit it to potential sites of viral damage and replication, resulting in enhanced production of infectious virus. These findings help to establish how EBV enlists and manipulates cellular DNA repair factors during the viral lytic cycle, contributing to efficient infectious virion production.

   REPLICATION
AB The castaneous (CAST) mouse, a wild-derived inbred strain, is highly susceptible to orthopoxvirus infection by intranasal and systemic routes. The 50% lethal intraperitoneal dose of vaccinia virus (VACV) was 3 PFU for CAST mice, whereas BALB/c mice survived 106 PFU. At all times and in all organs analyzed, virus titers were higher in CAST than in BALB/c mice. In individual CAST mice, luciferaseexpressing VACV was seen to replicate rapidly leading to death, whereas virus levels increased for a few days and then declined in BALB/c mice. Increases in gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were delayed and low in CAST mice compared to BALB/c mice following VACV infection or poly(I-C) inoculation, consistent with differences in innate immune responses. In addition, naive CAST mice had considerably lower numbers of NK and T cells than BALB/c mice. The percentage of IFN-gamma -producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells increased following infection of CAST mice only after considerable virus spread, and the absolute cell numbers remained low. Administration of exogenous IFN-gamma or -alpha to CAST mice before or during the first days of infection suppressed virus replication and prolonged survival, allowing the mice to make adaptive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses that were necessary to clear the virus after cessation of interferon treatment. Thus, insufficient innate cytokine and cellular immune responses contribute to the unique susceptibility of CAST mice to VACV, whereas the adaptive immune response can be protective only if virus replication is suppressed during the first several days of infection.
   IMPORTANCE Most inbred mouse strains are relatively resistant to orthopoxviruses. The castaneous (CAST) mouse is a notable exception, exhibiting extreme vulnerability to monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus and thus providing a unique model for studying pathogenicity, immunity, vaccines, and antiviral drugs. To fully utilize the CAST mouse for such purposes, it is necessary to understand the basis for virus susceptibility. We showed that naive CAST mice make low IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha responses and have low levels of NK cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to a resistant classical inbred mouse strain. Attenuating virus replication with one or more doses of exogenous IFN-alpha or -gamma before or during the first few days of infection enabled the development of adaptive cellular immunity and clearance of virus. Further genetic studies may reveal the basis for the low innate immunity.

AB We previously demonstrated that the combination of synthetic smallmolecule Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR7 ligands is a potent adjuvant for recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinin, inducing rapid and sustained immunity that is protective against influenza viruses in homologous, heterologous, and heterosubtypic murine challenge models. Combining the TLR4 and TLR7 ligands balances Th1 and Th2type immune responses for long-lived cellular and neutralizing humoral immunity against the viral hemagglutinin. Here, we demonstrate that the protective response induced in mice by this combined adjuvant is dependent upon TLR4 and TLR7 signaling via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), indicating that the adjuvants function in vivo via their known receptors, with negligible off-target effects, to induce protective immunity. The combined adjuvant acts via MyD88 in both bone marrow-derived and non-bone marrow-derived radioresistant cells to induce hemagglutinin-specific antibodies and protect mice against influenza virus challenge. The protective efficacy generated by immunization with this adjuvant and recombinant hemagglutinin antigen is transferable with serum from immunized mice to recipient mice in a homologous, but not a heterologous, H1N1 viral challenge model. Depletion of CD4(+) cells after an established humoral response in immunized mice does not impair protection from a homologous challenge; however, it does significantly impair recovery from a heterologous challenge virus, highlighting an important role for vaccine-induced CD4(+) cells in cross-protective vaccine efficacy. The combination of the two TLR agonists allows for significant dose reductions of each component to achieve a level of protection equivalent to that afforded by either single agent at its full dose.
   IMPORTANCE Development of novel adjuvants is needed to enhance immunogenicity to provide better protection from seasonal influenza virus infection and improve pandemic preparedness. We show here that several dose combinations of synthetic TLR4 and TLR7 ligands are potent adjuvants for recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinin antigen induction of humoral and cellular immunity against viral challenges. The components of the combined adjuvant work additively to enable both antigen and adjuvant dose sparing while retaining efficacy. Understanding an adjuvant's mechanism of action is a critical component for preclinical safety evaluation, and we demonstrate here that a combined TLR4 and TLR7 adjuvant signals via the appropriate receptors and the MyD88 adaptor protein. This novel adjuvant combination contributes to a more broadly protective vaccine while demonstrating an attractive safety profile.

AB Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a multifunctional protein encoded by members of the Rhadinovirus genus of gammaherpesviruses. Studies using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) demonstrated that LANA is important for acute replication, latency establishment, and reactivation in vivo. Despite structural similarities in their DNA-binding domains (DBDs), LANA homologs from Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and MHV68 exhibit considerable sequence divergence. We sought to determine if KSHV and MHV68 LANA homologs are functionally interchangeable. We generated an MHV68 virus that encodes KSHV LANA (kLANA) in place of MHV68 LANA (mLANA) and evaluated the virus's capacity to replicate, establish and maintain latency, and reactivate. kLANA knock-in (KLKI) MHV68 was replication competent in vitro and in vivo but exhibited slower growth kinetics and lower titers than wild-type (WT) MHV68. Following inoculation of mice, KLKI MHV68 established and maintained latency in splenocytes and peritoneal cells but did not reactivate efficiently ex vivo. kLANA repressed the MHV68 promoter for ORF50, the gene that encodes the major lytic transactivator protein RTA, while mLANA did not, suggesting a likely mechanism for the KLKI MHV68 phenotypes. Bypassing this repression by providing MHV68 RTA in trans rescued KLKI MHV68 replication in tissue culture and enabled detection of KLKI MHV68 reactivation ex vivo. These data demonstrate that kLANA and mLANA are functionally interchangeable for establishment and maintenance of latency and suggest that repression of lytic replication by kLANA, as previously shown with KSHV, is a kLANA-specific function that is transferable to MHV68.
   IMPORTANCE Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) are members of the Rhadinovirus genus of gammaherpesviruses. These viruses establish lifelong infections that place their respective human and murine hosts at risk for cancer. Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a conserved Rhadinovirus protein that is necessary for long-term chronic infection by these viruses. To better understand the conserved functions performed by LANA homologs, we generated a recombinant MHV68 virus that encodes the KSHV LANA protein in place of the MHV68 LANA homolog. We determined that the KSHV LANA protein is capable of supporting MHV68 latency in a mouse model of chronic infection but also functions to repress viral replication. This work describes an in vivo model system for defining evolutionarily conserved and divergent functions of LANA homologs in Rhadinovirus infection and disease.

AB Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is restricted to epithelial cells and neurons and is controlled by CD8 T cells. These cells both traffic to epithelial sites of recurrent lytic infection and to ganglia and persist at the dermal-epidermal junction for up to 12 weeks after lesion resolution. We previously showed that cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), a functional E-selectin ligand (ESL), is selectively expressed on circulating HSV-2-specific CD8 T cells. CLA/ESL mediates adhesion of T cells to inflamed vascular endothelium. Later stages in T-cell homing involve chemokines (Ch) and lymphocyte chemokine receptors (ChR) for vascular wall arrest and diapedesis. Several candidate ChR have been implicated in skin homing. We measured cell surface ChR on HSV-specific human peripheral blood CD8 T cells and extended our studies to HSV-1. We observed preferential cell surface expression of CCR10 and CXCR3 by HSV-specific CD8 T cells compared to CD8 T cells specific for control viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), and compared to bulk memory CD8 T cells. CXCR3 ligand mRNA levels were selectively increased in skin biopsy specimens from persons with recurrent HSV-2, while the mRNA levels of the CCR10 ligand CCL27 were equivalent in lesion and control skin. Our data are consistent with a model in which CCL27 drives baseline recruitment of HSV-specific CD8 T cells expressing CCR10, while interferon-responsive CXCR3 ligands recruit additional cells in response to virus-driven inflammation.
   IMPORTANCE HSV-2 causes very localized recurrent infections in the skin and genital mucosa. Virus-specific CD8 T cells home to the site of recurrent infection and participate in viral clearance. The exit of T cells from the blood involves the use of chemokine receptors on the T-cell surface and chemokines that are present in infected tissue. In this study, circulating HSV-2-specific CD8 T cells were identified using specific fluorescent tetramer reagents, and their expression of several candidate skin-homing-associated chemokine receptors was measured using flow cytometry. We found that two chemokine receptors, CXCR3 and CCR10, are upregulated on HSV-specific CD8 T cells in blood. The chemokines corresponding to these receptors are also expressed in infected tissues. Vaccine strategies to prime CD8 T cells to home to HSV lesions should elicit these chemokine receptors if possible to increase the homing of vaccine-primed cells to sites of infection.

AB In the search for effective immunologic interventions to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection, standardized reference reagents are a cost-effective way to maintain robustness and reproducibility among immunological assays. To support planned and ongoing studies where clade C predominates, here we describe three virus panels, chosen from 200 well-characterized clade C envelope (Env)-pseudotyped viruses from early infection. All 200 Envs were expressed as a single round of replication pseudoviruses and were tested to quantify neutralization titers by 16 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and sera from 30 subjects with chronic clade C infections. We selected large panels of 50 and 100 Envs either to characterize cross-reactive breadth for sera identified as having potent neutralization activity based on initial screening or to evaluate neutralization magnitude-breadth distributions of newly isolated antibodies. We identified these panels by downselection after hierarchical clustering of bnAb neutralization titers. The resulting panels represent the diversity of neutralization profiles throughout the range of virus sensitivities identified in the original panel of 200 viruses. A small 12-Env panel was chosen to screen sera from vaccine trials or naturalinfection studies for neutralization responses. We considered panels selected by previously described methods but favored a computationally informed method that enabled selection of viruses representing diverse neutralization sensitivity patterns, given that we do not a priori know what the neutralization-response profile of vaccine sera will be relative to that of sera from infected individuals. The resulting 12Env panel complements existing panels. Use of standardized panels enables direct comparisons of data from different trials and study sites testing HIV-1 clade C-specific products.
   IMPORTANCE HIV-1 group M includes nine clades and many recombinants. Clade C is the most common lineage, responsible for roughly half of current HIV-1 infections, and is a focus for vaccine design and testing. Standard reference reagents, particularly virus panels to study neutralization by antibodies, are crucial for developing cost-effective and yet rigorous and reproducible assays against diverse examples of this variable virus. We developed clade C-specific panels for use as standardized reagents to monitor complex polyclonal sera for neutralization activity and to characterize the potency and breadth of cross-reactive neutralization by monoclonal antibodies, whether engineered or isolated from infected individuals. We chose from 200 southern African, clade C envelope-pseudotyped viruses with neutralization titers against 16 broadly neutralizing antibodies and 30 sera from chronic clade C infections. We selected panels to represent the diversity of bnAb neutralization profiles and Env neutralization sensitivities. Use of standard virus panels can facilitate comparison of results across studies and sites.

AB We previously reported that the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax(301-309)-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (Tax(301-309)-CTLs) was highly restricted and a particular amino acid sequence motif, the PDR motif, was conserved among HLA-A*24:02-positive (HLA-A*24:02(+)) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Furthermore, we found that donor-derived PDR+ CTLs selectively expanded in ATL long-term HSCT survivors with strong CTL activity against HTLV-1. On the other hand, the TCR repertoires in Tax(301-309)-CTLs of asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) remain unclear. In this study, we directly identified the DNA sequence of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR-beta chain of Tax(301-309)-CTLs at the single-cell level and compared not only the TCR repertoires but also the frequencies and phenotypes of Tax(301-309)-CTLs between ACs and ATL patients. We did not observe any essential difference in the frequencies of Tax(301-309)-CTLs between ACs and ATL patients. In the single-cell TCR repertoire analysis of Tax(301-309)-CTLs, 1,458 Tax(301-309)-CTLs and 140 clones were identified in this cohort. Tax(301-309)-CTLs showed highly restricted TCR repertoires with a strongly biased usage of BV7, and PDR, the unique motif in TCR-beta CDR3, was exclusively observed in all ACs and ATL patients. However, there was no correlation between PDR+ CTL frequencies and HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL). In conclusion, we have identified, for the first time, a unique amino acid sequence, PDR, as a public TCR-CDR3 motif against Tax in HLA-A* 24:02(+) HTLV-1-infected individuals. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the role of the PDR+ CTL response in the progression from carrier state to ATL.
   IMPORTANCE ATL is an aggressive T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1 infection. The HTLV-1 regulatory protein Tax aggressively promotes the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes and is also a major target antigen for CD8(+) CTLs. In our previous evaluation of Tax(301-309)-CTLs, we found that a unique amino acid sequence motif, PDR, in CDR3 of the TCR-beta chain of Tax(301-309)-CTLs was conserved among ATL patients after allo-HSCT. Furthermore, the PDR+ Tax(301-309)-CTL clones selectively expanded and showed strong cytotoxic activities against HTLV-1. On the other hand, it remains unclear how Tax(301-309)-CTL repertoire exists in ACs. In this study, we comprehensively compared Tax-specific TCR repertoires at the single-cell level between ACs and ATL patients. Tax(301-309)-CTLs showed highly restricted TCR repertoires with a strongly biased usage of BV7, and PDR, the unique motif in TCR-beta CDR3, was conserved in all ACs and ATL patients, regardless of clinical subtype in HTLV-1 infection.

AB Astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1; mamastrovirus 9) is a recently discovered astrovirus genotype that is divergent from the classic human astroviruses (mamastrovirus 1). The gastrointestinal tract is presumed to be the primary site of infection and pathogenicity for astroviruses. However, VA1 has been independently detected in brain tissue of five cases of human encephalitis. Studies of the pathogenicity of VA1 are currently impossible because there are no reported cell culture systems or in vivo models that support VA1 infection. Here, we describe successful propagation of VA1 in multiple human cell lines. The initial inoculum, a filtered clinical stool sample from the index gastroenteritis case cluster that led to the discovery of VA1, was first passaged in Vero cells. Serial blind passage in Caco-2 cells yielded increasing copies of VA1 RNA, and multistep growth curves demonstrated a >100-fold increase in VA1 RNA 72 h after inoculation. The full-length genomic and subgenomic RNA strands were detected by Northern blotting, and crystalline lattices of viral particles of similar to 26-nm diameter were observed by electron microscopy in infected Caco-2 cells. Unlike other human astrovirus cell culture systems, which require addition of exogenous trypsin for continued propagation, VA1 could be propagated equally well with or without the addition of trypsin. Furthermore, VA1 was sensitive to the type I interferon (IFN-I) response, as VA1 RNA levels were reduced by pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with IFN-beta 1a. The ability to propagate VA1 in cell culture will facilitate studies of the neurotropism and neuropathogenesis of VA1.
   IMPORTANCE Astroviruses are an emerging cause of central nervous system infections in mammals, and astrovirus VA1/HMO-C is the most prevalent astrovirus in cases of human encephalitis. This virus has not been previously propagated, preventing elucidation of the biology of this virus. We describe the first cell culture system for VA1, a key step necessary for the study of its ability to cause disease.

AB Primary infection of a plant with a pathogen that causes high accumulation of salicylic acid in the plant typically via a hypersensitive response confers enhanced resistance against secondary infection with a broad spectrum of pathogens, including viruses. This phenomenon is called systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which is a plant priming for adaption to repeated biotic stress. However, the molecular mechanisms of SAR-mediated enhanced inhibition, especially of virus infection, remain unclear. Here, we show that SAR against cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) involves a calmodulin-like protein, rgs-CaM. We previously reported the antiviral function of rgs-CaM, which binds to and directs degradation of viral RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs), including CMV 2b, via autophagy. We found that rgs-CaM-mediated immunity is ineffective against CMV infection in normally growing tobacco plants but is activated as a result of SAR induction via salicylic acid signaling. We then analyzed the effect of overexpression of rgs-CaM on salicylic acid signaling. Overexpressed and ectopically expressed rgs-CaM induced defense reactions, including cell death, generation of reactive oxygen species, and salicylic acid signaling. Further analysis using a combination of the salicylic acid analogue benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 revealed that rgs-CaM functions as an immune receptor that induces salicylic acid signaling by simultaneously perceiving both viral RSS and Ca2+ influx as infection cues, implying its autoactivation. Thus, secondary infection of SAR-induced tobacco plants with CMV seems to be effectively inhibited through 2b recognition and degradation by rgs-CaM, leading to reinforcement of antiviral RNA silencing and other salicylic acid-mediated antiviral responses.
   IMPORTANCE Even without an acquired immune system like that in vertebrates, plants show enhanced whole-plant resistance against secondary infection with pathogens; this so-called systemic acquired resistance (SAR) has been known for more than half a century and continues to be extensively studied. SAR-induced plants strongly and rapidly express a number of antibiotics and pathogenesis-related proteins targeted against secondary infection, which can account for enhanced resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens but are not thought to control viral infection. This study showed that enhanced resistance against cucumber mosaic virus is caused by a tobacco calmodulin-like protein, rgs-CaM, which detects and counteracts the major viral virulence factor (RNA silencing suppressor) after SAR induction. rgs-CaM-mediated SAR illustrates the growth versus defense trade-off in plants, as it targets the major virulence factor only under specific biotic stress conditions, thus avoiding the cost of constitutive activation while reducing the damage from virus infection.

TI Role of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Matrix (M) Protein in

AB Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a pathogenic fish rhabdovirus found in discrete locales throughout the Northern Hemisphere. VHSV infection of fish cells leads to upregulation of the host's virus detection response, but the virus quickly suppresses interferon (IFN) production and antiviral gene expression. By systematically screening each of the six VHSV structural and nonstructural genes, we identified matrix protein (M) as the virus' most potent antihost protein. Only M of VHSV genotype IV sublineage b (VHSV-IVb) suppressed mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and type I IFN-induced gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. M also suppressed the constitutively active simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter and globally decreased cellular RNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies illustrated that M inhibited RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) recruitment to gene promoters and decreased RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) Ser2 phosphorylation during VHSV infection. However, transcription directed by RNAP I to III was suppressed by M. To identify regions of functional importance, M proteins from a variety of VHSV strains were tested in cell-based transcriptional inhibition assays. M of a particular VHSV-Ia strain, F1, was significantly less potent than IVb M at inhibiting SV40/ luciferase (Luc) expression yet differed by just 4 amino acids. Mutation of D62 to alanine alone, or in combination with an E181-to-alanine mutation (D62A E181A), dramatically reduced the ability of IVb M to suppress host transcription. Introducing either M D62A or D62A E181A mutations into VHSV-IVb via reverse genetics resulted in viruses that replicated efficiently but exhibited less cytotoxicity and reduced anti-transcriptional activities, implicating M as a primary regulator of cytopathicity and host transcriptional suppression.
   IMPORTANCE Viruses must suppress host antiviral responses to replicate and spread between hosts. In these studies, we identified the matrix protein of the deadly fish novirhabdovirus VHSV as a critical mediator of host suppression during infection. Our studies indicated that M alone could block cellular gene expression at very low expression levels. We identified several subtle mutations in M that were less potent at suppressing host transcription. When these mutations were engineered back into recombinant viruses, the resulting viruses replicated well but elicited less toxicity in infected cells and activated host innate immune responses more robustly. These data demonstrated that VHSV M plays an important role in mediating both virusinduced cell toxicity and viral replication. Our data suggest that its roles in these two processes can be separated to design effective attenuated viruses for vaccine candidates.

AB Herpesvirus capsids assemble in the nucleus, while final virion maturation proceeds in the cytoplasm. This requires that newly formed nucleocapsids cross the nuclear envelope (NE), which occurs by budding at the inner nuclear membrane (INM), release of the primary enveloped virion into the perinuclear space (PNS), and subsequent rapid fusion with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). During this process, the NE remains intact, even at late stages of infection. In addition, the spacing between the INM and ONM is maintained, as is that between the primary virion envelope and nuclear membranes. The linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex consists of INM proteins with a luminal SUN (Sad1/UNC-84 homology) domain connected to ONM proteins with a KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, SYNE homology) domain and is thought to be responsible for spacing the nuclear membranes. To investigate the role of the LINC complex during herpesvirus infection, we generated cell lines constitutively expressing dominant negative (dn) forms of SUN1 and SUN2. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a significant expansion of the PNS and the contiguous intracytoplasmic lumen, most likely representing endoplasmic reticulum (ER), especially in cells expressing dn-SUN2. After infection, primary virions accumulated in these expanded luminal regions, also very distant from the nucleus. The importance of the LINC complex was also confirmed by reduced progeny virus titers in cells expressing dn-SUN2. These data show that the intact LINC complex is required for efficient nuclear egress of herpesviruses, likely acting to promote fusion of primary enveloped virions with the ONM.
   IMPORTANCE While the viral factors for primary envelopment of nucleocapsids at the inner nuclear membrane are known to the point of high-resolution structures, the roles of cellular components and regulators remain enigmatic. Furthermore, the machinery responsible for fusion with the outer nuclear membrane is unsolved. We show here that dominant negative SUN2 interferes with efficient herpesvirus nuclear egress, apparently by interfering with fusion between the primary virion envelope and outer nuclear membrane. This identifies a new cellular component important for viral egress and implicates LINC complex integrity in nonconventional nuclear membrane trafficking.

   Its Acidic Residues with Factor I

AB Poxviruses display species tropism-variola virus is a human-specific virus, while vaccinia virus causes repeated outbreaks in dairy cattle. Consistent with this, variola virus complement regulator SPICE (smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes) exhibits selectivity in inhibiting the human alternative complement pathway and vaccinia virus complement regulator VCP (vaccinia virus complement control protein) displays selectivity in inhibiting the bovine alternative complement pathway. In the present study, we examined the species specificity of VCP and SPICE for the classical pathway (CP). We observed that VCP is similar to 43-fold superior to SPICE in inhibiting bovine CP. Further, functional assays revealed that increased inhibitory activity of VCP for bovine CP is solely due to its enhanced cofactor activity, with no effect on decay of bovine CP C3-convertase. To probe the structural basis of this specificity, we utilized single-and multi-amino-acid substitution mutants wherein 1 or more of the 11 variant VCP residues were substituted in the SPICE template. Examination of these mutants for their ability to inhibit bovine CP revealed that E108, E120, and E144 are primarily responsible for imparting the specificity and contribute to the enhanced cofactor activity of VCP. Binding and functional assays suggested that these residues interact with bovine factor I but not with bovine C4(H2O) (a moiety conformationally similar to C4b). Mapping of these residues onto the modeled structure of bovine C4b-VCP-bovine factor I supported the mutagenesis data. Taken together, our data help explain why the vaccine strain of vaccinia virus was able to gain a foothold in domesticated animals.
   IMPORTANCE Vaccinia virus was used for smallpox vaccination. The vaccine-derived virus is now circulating and causing outbreaks in dairy cattle in India and Brazil. However, the reason for this tropism is unknown. It is well recognized that the virus is susceptible to neutralization by the complement classical pathway (CP). Because the virus encodes a soluble complement regulator, VCP, we examined whether this protein displays selectivity in targeting bovine CP. Our data show that it does exhibit selectivity in inhibiting the bovine CP and that this is primarily determined by its amino acids E108, E120, and E144, which interact with bovine serine protease factor I to inactivate bovine C4b-one of the two subunits of CP C3-convertase. Of note, the variola complement regulator SPICE contains positively charged residues at these positions. Thus, these variant residues in VCP help enhance its potency against the bovine CP and thereby the fitness of the virus in cattle.

AB During infection Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) generally enters host cells via receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The trafficking of JEV within endosomes is controlled by Rab GTPases, but which Rab proteins are involved in JEV entry into BHK-21 cells is unknown. In this study, entry and post-internalization of JEV were analyzed using biochemical inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant negative (DN) mutants. Our data demonstrate that JEV entry into BHK-21 cells depends on clathrin, dynamin, and cholesterol but not on caveolae or macropinocytosis. The effect on JEV infection of dominant negative (DN) mutants of four Rab proteins that regulate endosomal trafficking was examined. Expression of DN Rab5 and DN Rab11, but not DN Rab7 and DN Rab9, significantly inhibited JEV replication. These results were further tested by silencing Rab5 or Rab11 expression before viral infection. Confocal microscopy showed that virus particles colocalized with Rab5 or Rab11 within 15 min after virus entry, suggesting that after internalization JEV moves to early and recycling endosomes before the release of the viral genome. Our findings demonstrate the roles of Rab5 and Rab11 on JEV infection of BHK-21 cells through the endocytic pathway, providing new insights into the life cycle of flaviviruses.
   IMPORTANCE Although Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) utilizes different endocytic pathways depending on the cell type being infected, the detailed mechanism of its entry into BHK-21 cells is unknown. Understanding the process of JEV endocytosis and postinternalization will advance our knowledge of JEV infection and pathogenesis as well as provide potential novel drug targets for antiviral intervention. With this objective, we used systematic approaches to dissect this process. The results show that entry of JEV into BHK-21 cells requires a low-pH environment and that the process occurs through dynamin-, actin-, and cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis that requires Rab5 and Rab11. Our work provides a detailed picture of the entry of JEV into BHK-21 cells and the cellular events that follow.

AB Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a naturally occurring, fatal neurodegenerative disease of cervids. The potential for swine to serve as hosts for the agent of CWD is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of swine to the CWD agent following experimental oral or intracranial inoculation. Crossbred piglets were assigned to three groups, intracranially inoculated (n = 20), orally inoculated (n = 19), and noninoculated (n = 9). At approximately the age at which commercial pigs reach market weight, half of the pigs in each group were culled ("market weight" groups). The remaining pigs ("aged" groups) were allowed to incubate for up to 73 months postinoculation (mpi). Tissues collected at necropsy were examined for disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) by Western blotting (WB), antigen capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in vitro real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). Brain samples from selected pigs were also bioassayed in mice expressing porcine prion protein. Four intracranially inoculated aged pigs and one orally inoculated aged pig were positive by EIA, IHC, and/or WB. By RT-QuIC, PrPSc was detected in lymphoid and/or brain tissue from one or more pigs in each inoculated group. The bioassay was positive in four out of five pigs assayed. This study demonstrates that pigs can support low-level amplification of CWD prions, although the species barrier to CWD infection is relatively high. However, detection of infectivity in orally inoculated pigs with a mouse bioassay raises the possibility that naturally exposed pigs could act as a reservoir of CWD infectivity.
   IMPORTANCE We challenged domestic swine with the chronic wasting disease agent by inoculation directly into the brain (intracranially) or by oral gavage (orally). Disease-associated prion protein (PrPSc) was detected in brain and lymphoid tissues from intracranially and orally inoculated pigs as early as 8 months of age (6 months postinoculation). Only one pig developed clinical neurologic signs suggestive of prion disease. The amount of PrPSc in the brains and lymphoid tissues of positive pigs was small, especially in orally inoculated pigs. Regardless, positive results obtained with orally inoculated pigs suggest that it may be possible for swine to serve as a reservoir for prion disease under natural conditions.

We have previously proposed a model where subcomplexes of vRNA are exported from the nucleus and assembled en route to the plasma membrane. However, the role of host cytoskeletal proteins in the cytoplasmic assembly of IAV vRNA segments remains unknown. Previous studies have suggested that IAV vRNA segments are transported via Rab11A-containing recycling endosomes (RE) and use both microtubules (MT) and actin. Rab11A RE transport primarily along MT; therefore, investigation of the role of MT in vRNA assembly is warranted. We explored the role of MT in vRNA assembly and replication by using multiple IAV strains in various cell types, including primary human airway epithelial cells. We observed that Rab11A localization was altered in the presence of MTdepolymerizing drugs, but growth of IAV in all of the cell types tested was unchanged. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed to determine the role of MT in the assembly of multiple vRNA segments. Unexpectedly, we found that vRNAvRNA association in cytoplasmic foci was independent of MT. Given the disparity of localization between Rab11A and vRNA segments in the absence of intact MT filaments, we analyzed the three-dimensional spatial relationship between Rab11A and vRNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells. We found that Rab11A and vRNA colocalization is dependent upon dynamic MT filaments. Taken together, our data suggest that cytoplasmic transport of influenza vRNA may include a Rab11A RE-independent mechanism.
   IMPORTANCE IAV infections cause a large public health burden through seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Pandemic IAVs emerge through reassortment of vRNA in animal or human hosts. Elucidation of the mechanism of intracellular dynamics of IAV assembly is necessary to understand reassortment. Our results describing the role of MT in vRNA transport and assembly expand upon previous studies characterizing vRNA assembly. This study is the first to assess the role of MT in influenza virus replication in human bronchial airway epithelial cells. In addition, we present novel data on the role of MT in facilitating the association between distinct vRNA segments. Interestingly, our results suggest that progressive assembly of vRNA segments may be cell type dependent and that vRNA may be transported through the cytoplasm without Rab11A RE in the absence of intact MT. These results enhance our understanding of vRNA assembly and the role of cytoskeletal proteins in that process.

AB Several lines of evidence indicate that cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) types belonging to the beta genus of the HPV phylogenetic tree synergize with UV radiation in the development of skin cancer. Accordingly, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins from some beta HPV types are able to deregulate pathways related to immune response and cellular transformation. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), in addition to playing a role in innate immunity, has been shown to be involved in the cellular stress response. Using primary human keratinocytes as experimental models, we have shown that UV irradiation (and other cellular stresses) activates TLR9 expression. This event is closely linked to p53 activation. Silencing the expression of p53 or deleting its encoding gene affected the activation of TLR9 expression after UV irradiation. Using various strategies, we have also shown that the transcription factors p53 and c-Jun are recruited onto a specific region of the TLR9 promoter after UV irradiation. Importantly, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins from beta HPV38, by inducing the accumulation of the p53 antagonist.Np73 similar to, prevent the UV-mediated recruitment of these transcription factors onto the TLR9 promoter, with subsequent impairment of TLR9 gene expression. This study provides new insight into the mechanism that mediates TLR9 upregulation in response to cellular stresses. In addition, we show that HPV38 E6 and E7 are able to interfere with this mechanism, providing another explanation for the possible cooperation of beta HPV types with UV radiation in skin carcinogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Beta HPV types have been suggested to act as cofactors in UVinduced skin carcinogenesis by altering several cellular mechanisms activated by UV radiation. We show that the expression of TLR9, a sensor of damage-associated molecular patterns produced during cellular stress, is activated by UV radiation in primary human keratinocytes (PHKs). Two transcription factors known to be activated by UV radiation, p53 and c-Jun, play key roles in UV-activated TLR9 expression. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins from beta HPV38 strongly inhibit UV-activated TLR9 expression by preventing the recruitment of p53 and c-Jun to the TLR9 promoter. Our findings provide additional support for the role that beta HPV types play in skin carcinogenesis by preventing activation of specific pathways upon exposure of PHKs to UV radiation.

AB Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor. While bat, camel, and human DPP4 support MERS-CoV infection, several DPP4 orthologs, including mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4, do not. Previous work revealed that glycosylation of mouse DPP4 plays a role in blocking MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested whether glycosylation also acts as a determinant of permissivity for ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4. We found that, while glycosylation plays an important role in these orthologs, additional sequence and structural determinants impact their ability to act as functional receptors for MERS-CoV. These results provide insight into DPP4 species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range and better inform our understanding of virus-receptor interactions associated with disease emergence and host susceptibility.
   IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is a recently emerged zoonotic virus that is still circulating in the human population with an similar to 35% mortality rate. With no available vaccines or therapeutics, the study of MERS-CoV pathogenesis is crucial for its control and prevention. However, in vivo studies are limited because MERS-CoV cannot infect wildtype mice due to incompatibilities between the virus spike and the mouse host cell receptor, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4). Specifically, mDPP4 has a nonconserved glycosylation site that acts as a barrier to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, one mouse model strategy has been to modify the mouse genome to remove this glycosylation site. Here, we investigated whether glycosylation acts as a barrier to infection for other nonpermissive small-animal species, namely, ferret, guinea pig, and hamster. Understanding the virus-receptor interactions for these DPP4 orthologs will help in the development of additional animal models while also revealing speciesspecific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range.

AB Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and hospitalizations. RSV can also cause severe complications in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. There is no licensed vaccine. We previously generated a parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-vectored vaccine candidate expressing the RSV fusion protein (F) that was immunogenic and protective in mice. In this work, our goal was to improve the original vaccine candidate by modifying the PIV5 vector or by modifying the RSV F antigen. We previously demonstrated that insertion of a foreign gene at the PIV5 small hydrophobic (SH)-hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) junction or deletion of PIV5 SH increased vaccine efficacy. Additionally, other groups have demonstrated that antibodies against the prefusion conformation of RSV F have more potent neutralizing activity than antibodies against the postfusion conformation. Therefore, to improve on our previously developed vaccine candidate, we inserted RSV F at the PIV5 SH-HN gene junction or used RSV F to replace PIV5 SH. We also engineered PIV5 to express a prefusion-stabilized F mutant. The candidates were tested in BALB/c mice via the intranasal route and induced both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. They also protected against RSV infection in the mouse lung. When they were administered intranasally or subcutaneously in cotton rats, the candidates were highly immunogenic and reduced RSV loads in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. PIV5-RSV F was equally protective when administered intranasally or subcutaneously. In all cases, the prefusion F mutant did not induce higher neutralizing antibody titers than wild-type F. These results show that antibodies against both pre-and postfusion F are important for neutralizing RSV and should be considered when designing a vectored RSV vaccine. The findings also that indicate PIV5-RSV F may be administered subcutaneously, which is the preferred route for vaccinating infants, who may develop nasal congestion as a result of intranasal vaccination.
   IMPORTANCE Despite decades of research, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is still a major health concern for which there is no vaccine. A parainfluenza virus 5-vectored vaccine expressing the native RSV fusion protein (F) has previously been shown to confer robust immunity against RSV infection in mice, cotton rats, and nonhuman primates. To improve our previous vaccine candidate, we developed four new candidates that incorporate modifications to the PIV5 backbone, replace native RSV F with a prefusion-stabilized RSV F mutant, or combine both RSV F and PIV5 backbone modifications. In this work, we characterized the new vaccine candidates and tested their efficacies in both murine and cotton rat models of RSV infection. Most importantly, we found that PIV5-based RSV vaccine candidates were efficacious in preventing lower respiratory tract infection as well as in reducing the nasal viral load when administered via the subcutaneous route.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of dividing and nondividing cells involves regulatory interactions with the nuclear pore complex (NPC), followed by translocation to the nucleus and preferential integration into genomic areas in proximity to the inner nuclear membrane (INM). To identify host proteins that may contribute to these processes, we performed an overexpression screen of known membrane-associated NE proteins. We found that the integral transmembrane proteins SUN1/UNC84A and SUN2/UNC84B are potent or modest inhibitors of HIV-1 infection, respectively, and that suppression corresponds to defects in the accumulation of viral cDNA in the nucleus. While laboratory strains (HIV-1NL4.3 and HIV-1IIIB) are sensitive to SUN1-mediated inhibition, the transmitted founder viruses RHPA and ZM247 are largely resistant. Using chimeric viruses, we identified the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein as a major determinant of sensitivity to SUN1, and in vitro-assembled capsid-nucleocapsid (CANC) nanotubes captured SUN1 and SUN2 from cell lysates. Finally, we generated SUN1(-/-) and SUN2(-/-) cells by using CRISPR/Cas9 and found that the loss of SUN1 had no effect on HIV-1 infectivity, whereas the loss of SUN2 had a modest suppressive effect. Taken together, these observations suggest that SUN1 and SUN2 may function redundantly to modulate postentry, nuclear-associated steps of HIV-1 infection.
   IMPORTANCE HIV-1 causes more than 1 million deaths per year. The life cycle of HIV-1 has been studied extensively, yet important steps that occur between viral capsid release into the cytoplasm and the expression of viral genes remain elusive. We propose here that the INM components SUN1 and SUN2, two members of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, may interact with incoming HIV-1 replication complexes and affect key steps of infection. While overexpression of these proteins reduces HIV-1 infection, disruption of the individual SUN2 and SUN1 genes leads to a mild reduction or no effect on infectivity, respectively. We speculate that SUN1/SUN2 may function redundantly in early HIV-1 infection steps and therefore influence HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis.

AB Poxviruses replicate within the cytoplasm and encode proteins for DNA and mRNA synthesis. To investigate poxvirus replication and transcription from a new perspective, we incorporated 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) into nascent DNA in cells infected with vaccinia virus (VACV). The EdU-labeled DNA was conjugated to fluor-or biotin-azide and visualized by confocal, superresolution, and transmission electron microscopy. Nuclear labeling decreased dramatically after infection, accompanied by intense labeling of cytoplasmic foci. The nascent DNA colocalized with the VACV single-stranded DNA binding protein I3 in multiple puncta throughout the interior of factories, which were surrounded by endoplasmic reticulum. Complexes containing EdU-biotin-labeled DNA cross-linked to proteins were captured on streptavidin beads. After elution and proteolysis, the peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with nascent DNA. The known viral replication proteins, a telomere binding protein, and a protein kinase were associated with nascent DNA, as were the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and intermediate-and late-stage transcription initiation and elongation factors, plus the capping and methylating enzymes. These results suggested that the replicating pool of DNA is transcribed and that few if any additional viral proteins directly engaged in replication and transcription remain to be discovered. Among the host proteins identified by mass spectrometry, topoisomerases II alpha and II beta and PCNA were noteworthy. The association of the topoisomerases with nascent DNA was dependent on expression of the viral DNA ligase, in accord with previous proteomic studies. Further investigations are needed to determine possible roles for PCNA and other host proteins detected.
   IMPORTANCE Poxviruses, unlike many well-characterized animal DNA viruses, replicate entirely within the cytoplasm of animal cells, raising questions regarding the relative roles of viral and host proteins. We adapted newly developed procedures for click chemistry and iPOND (Isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) to investigate vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototype poxvirus. Nuclear DNA synthesis ceased almost immediately following VACV infection, followed swiftly by the synthesis of viral DNA within discrete cytoplasmic foci. All viral proteins known from genetic and proteomic studies to be required for poxvirus DNA replication were identified in the complexes containing nascent DNA. The additional detection of the viral DNAdependent RNA polymerase and intermediate and late transcription factors provided evidence for a temporal coupling of replication and transcription. Further studies are needed to assess the potential roles of host proteins, including topoisomerases II alpha and II beta and PCNA, which were found associated with nascent DNA.

TI Stability of Cucumber Necrosis Virus at the Quasi-6-Fold Axis Affects

AB Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) is a member of the genus Tombusvirus and has a monopartite positive-sense RNA genome. CNV is transmitted in nature via zoospores of the fungus Olpidium bornovanus. As with other members of the Tombusvirus genus, the CNV capsid swells when exposed to alkaline pH and EDTA. We previously demonstrated that a P73G mutation blocks the virus from zoospore transmission while not significantly affecting replication in plants (K. Kakani, R. Reade, and D. Rochon, J Mol Biol 338: 507-517, 2004, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.008). P73 lies immediately adjacent to a putative zinc binding site (M. Li et al., J Virol 87: 12166 -12175, 2013, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01965-13) that is formed by three icosahedrally related His residues in the N termini of the C subunit at the quasi-6-fold axes. To better understand how this buried residue might affect vector transmission, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of wild-type CNV in the native and swollen state and of the transmission-defective mutant, P73G, under native conditions. With the wild-type CNV, the swollen structure demonstrated the expected expansion of the capsid. However, the zinc binding region at the quasi-6-fold at the beta-annulus axes remained intact. By comparison, the zinc binding region of the P73G mutant, even under native conditions, was markedly disordered, suggesting that the beta-annulus had been disrupted and that this could destabilize the capsid. This was confirmed with pH and urea denaturation experiments in conjunction with electron microscopy analysis. We suggest that the P73G mutation affects the zinc binding and/or the beta-annulus, making it more fragile under neutral/basic pH conditions. This, in turn, may affect zoospore transmission.
   IMPORTANCE Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV), a member of the genus Tombusvirus, is transmitted in nature via zoospores of the fungus Olpidium bornovanus. While a number of plant viruses are transmitted via insect vectors, little is known at the molecular level as to how the viruses are recognized and transmitted. As with many spherical plant viruses, the CNV capsid swells when exposed to alkaline pH and EDTA. We previously demonstrated that a P73G mutation that lies inside the capsid immediately adjacent to a putative zinc binding site (Li et al., J Virol 87: 1216612175, 2013, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01965-13) blocks the virus from zoospore transmission while not significantly affecting replication in plants (K. Kakani, R. Reade, and D. Rochon, J Mol Biol 338: 507-517, 2004, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.008). Here, we show that the P73G mutant is less stable than the wild type, and this appears to be correlated with destabilization of the beta-annulus at the icosahedral 3-fold axes. Therefore, the beta-annulus appears not to be essential for particle assembly but is necessary for interactions with the transmission vector.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, generally causes self-limiting acute viral hepatitis, although chronic HEV infection has recently become a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised individuals, especially in solid-organ transplant recipients. Innate immunity, via the type I interferon (IFN) response, plays an important role during the initial stages of a viral infection. IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), an IFN-induced ubiquitin-like protein, is known to have an immunomodulatory role and can have a direct antiviral effect on a wide spectrum of virus families. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect as well as the potential immunomodulatory role of ISG15 during HEV replication. The results revealed that HEV induced high levels of ISG15 production both in vitro (Huh7-S10-3 liver cells) and in vivo (liver tissues from HEV-infected pigs); however, ISG15 is not required for virus replication. We also demonstrated that ISG15 silencing potentiates enhanced type I IFN-mediated signaling, resulting in an increase in the type I IFN-mediated antiviral effect during HEV replication. This observed enhanced type I IFN signaling correlated with an increase in IFN-stimulated gene expression levels during HEV replication. Furthermore, we showed that PKR and OAS1 played important roles in the ISG15-mediated type I IFN sensitivity of HEV. Taken together, the results from this study suggest that ISG15 plays an important immunomodulatory role and regulates HEV sensitivity to exogenous type I IFN.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection typically causes self-limiting acute viral hepatitis. However, chronic HEV infection has recently become a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised patients. Pegylated interferon (IFN) has been used to treat chronic HEV infection in solid-organ transplant patients with some success. However, the mechanism behind the type I IFN-mediated antiviral effect against HEV remains unclear. This report demonstrates that ISG15 induced by HEV replication in Huh7-S10-3 human liver cells plays an immunomodulatory role by negatively regulating type I IFN signaling and, thus, HEV sensitivity to type I IFN. Our results also show that PKR and OAS1 play important roles in the ISG15-mediated type I IFN sensitivity of HEV.

AB The recent outbreak of avian origin H10N7 influenza among seals in northern Europe and two fatal human infections with an avian H10N8 virus in China have demonstrated that H10 viruses can spread between mammals and cause severe disease in humans. To gain insight into the potential for H10 viruses to cross the species barrier and to identify a candidate vaccine strain, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo properties and antibody response in ferrets to 20 diverse H10 viruses. H10 virus infection of ferrets caused variable weight loss, and all 20 viruses replicated throughout the respiratory tract; however, replication in the lungs was highly variable. In glycan-binding assays, the H10 viruses preferentially bound "avianlike" alpha 2,3-linked sialic acids. Importantly, several isolates also displayed strong binding to long-chain "human-like" alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids and exhibited comparable or elevated neuraminidase activity relative to human H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 viruses. In hemagglutination inhibition assays, 12 antisera cross-reacted with >= 14 of 20 H10 viruses, and 7 viruses induced neutralizing activity against >= 15 of the 20 viruses. By combining data on weight loss, viral replication, and the cross-reactive antibody response, we identified A/mallard/Portugal/79906/2009 (H10N7) as a suitable virus for vaccine development. Collectively, our findings suggest that H10 viruses may continue to sporadically infect humans and other mammals, underscoring the importance of developing an H10 vaccine for pandemic preparedness.
   IMPORTANCE Avian origin H10 influenza viruses sporadically infect humans and other mammals; however, little is known about viruses of this subtype. Thus, we characterized the biological properties of 20 H10 viruses in vitro and in ferrets. Infection caused mild to moderate weight loss (5 to 15%), with robust viral replication in the nasal tissues and variable replication in the lung. H10 viruses preferentially bind "avian-like" sialic acids, although several isolates also displayed binding to "human-like" sialic acid receptors. This is consistent with the ability of H10 viruses to cross the species barrier and warrants selection of an H10 vaccine strain. By evaluating the cross-reactive antibody response to the H10 viruses and combining this analysis with viral replication and weight loss findings, we identified A/mallard/Portugal/79906/2009 (H10N7) as a suitable H10 vaccine strain.

AB A highly conserved threonine near the C terminus of gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was investigated for its contributions to envelope protein function and virion infectivity. When this highly conserved Thr residue was substituted with anything other than serine (the other amino acid that can accept O-glycosylation), the resulting virus was noninfectious. We found that this Thr was critical for the association of gp120 with the virion and that amino acid substitution increased the amount of dissociated gp120 in the cell culture supernatant. When HIV virions were generated in cells overexpressing polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (GalNAcT1), viral infectivity was increased 2.5-fold compared to that of virus produced in wildtype HEK293T cells; infectivity was increased 8-fold when the Thr499Ser mutant was used. These infectivity enhancements were not observed when GalNAcT3 was used. Using HEK293T knockout cell lines totally devoid of the ability to perform O-linked glycosylation, we demonstrated production of normal levels of virions and normal levels of infectivity in the complete absence of O-linked carbohydrate. Our data indicate that O-glycosylation is not necessary for the natural replication cycle of HIV and SIV. Nonetheless, it remains theoretically possible that the repertoire of GalNAc transferase isoforms in natural target cells for HIV and SIV in vivo could result in O-glycosylation of the threonine residue in question and that this could boost the infectivity of virions beyond the levels seen in the absence of such O-glycosylation.
   IMPORTANCE Approximately 50% of the mass of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of both HIV and SIV is N-linked carbohydrate. One of the contributions of this N-linked carbohydrate is to shield conserved peptide sequences from recognition by humoral immunity. This N-linked glycosylation is one of the reasons that primary isolates of HIV and SIV are so heavily resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization. Much less studied is any potential contribution from O-linked glycosylation. The literature on this topic to date is somewhat confusing and ambiguous. Our studies described in this report demonstrate unambiguously that O-linked glycosylation is not necessary for the natural replication cycle of HIV and SIV. However, the door is not totally closed because of the diversity of numerous GalNAc transferase enzymes that initiate O-linked carbohydrate attachment and the theoretical possibility that natural target cells for HIV and SIV in vivo could potentially complete such O-linked carbohydrate attachment to further increase infectivity.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a strongly conserved DNA virus, highrisk types of which can cause cervical cancer in persistent infections. The most common type found in HPV-attributable cancer is HPV16, which can be subdivided into four lineages (A to D) with different carcinogenic properties. Studies have shown HPV16 sequence diversity in different geographical areas, but only limited information is available regarding HPV16 diversity within a population, especially at the whole-genome level. We analyzed HPV16 major variant diversity and conservation in persistent infections and performed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparison between persistent and clearing infections. Materials were obtained in the Netherlands from a cohort study with longitudinal follow-up for up to 3 years. Our analysis shows a remarkably large variant diversity in the population. Wholegenome sequences were obtained for 57 persistent and 59 clearing HPV16 infections, resulting in 109 unique variants. Interestingly, persistent infections were completely conserved through time. One reinfection event was identified where the initial and follow-up samples clustered differently. Non-A1/A2 variants seemed to clear preferentially (P = 0.02). Our analysis shows that population-wide HPV16 sequence diversity is very large. In persistent infections, the HPV16 sequence was fully conserved. Sequencing can identify HPV16 reinfections, although occurrence is rare. SNP comparison identified no strongly acting effect of the viral genome affecting HPV16 infection clearance or persistence in up to 3 years of follow-up. These findings suggest the progression of an early HPV16 infection could be host related.
   IMPORTANCE Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is the predominant type found in cervical cancer. Progression of initial infection to cervical cancer has been linked to sequence properties; however, knowledge of variants circulating in European populations, especially with longitudinal follow-up, is limited. By sequencing a number of infections with known follow-up for up to 3 years, we gained initial insights into the genetic diversity of HPV16 and the effects of the viral genome on the persistence of infections. A SNP comparison between sequences obtained from clearing and persistent infections did not identify strongly acting DNA variations responsible for these infection outcomes. In addition, we identified an HPV16 reinfection event where sequencing of initial and follow-up samples showed different HPV16 variants. Based on conventional genotyping, this infection would incorrectly be considered a persistent HPV16 infection. In the context of vaccine efficacy and monitoring studies, such infections could potentially cause reduced reported efficacy or efficiency.

AB The RV144 HIV vaccine trial included a recombinant HIV glycoprotein 120 (gp120) construct fused to a small portion of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) so that the first 40 amino acids of gp120 were replaced by the signal sequence and the first 27 amino acids of the mature form of gD. This region of gD contains most of the binding site for HVEM, an HSV receptor important for virus infection of epithelial cells and lymphocytes. RV144 induced antibodies to HIV that were partially protective against infection, as well as antibodies to HSV. We derived monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from peripheral blood B cells of recipients of the RV144 HIV vaccine and showed that these antibodies neutralized HSV-1 infection in cells expressing HVEM, but not the other major virus receptor, nectin-1. The MAbs mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and mice that received the MAbs and were then challenged by corneal inoculation with HSV-1 had reduced eye disease, shedding, and latent infection. To our knowledge, this is the first description of MAbs derived from human recipients of a vaccine that specifically target the HVEM binding site of gD. In summary, we found that monoclonal antibodies derived from humans vaccinated with the HVEM binding domain of HSV-1 gD (i) neutralized HSV-1 infection in a cell receptor-specific manner, (ii) mediated ADCC, and (iii) reduced ocular disease in virus-infected mice.
   IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes cold sores and neonatal herpes and is a leading cause of blindness. Despite many trials, no HSV vaccine has been approved. Nectin-1 and HVEM are the two major cellular receptors for HSV. These receptors are expressed at different levels in various tissues, and the role of each receptor in HSV pathogenesis is not well understood. We derived human monoclonal antibodies from persons who received the HIV RV144 vaccine that contained the HVEM binding domain of HSV-1 gD fused to HIV gp120. These antibodies were able to specifically neutralize HSV-1 infection in vitro via HVEM. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that HVEM-specific HSV-1 neutralizing antibodies protect mice from HSV-1 eye disease, indicating the critical role of HVEM in HSV-1 ocular infection.

TI Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 UL20 to GODZ (DHHC3) Affects Its

AB Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL20 plays a crucial role in the envelopment of the cytoplasmic virion and its egress. It is a nonglycosylated envelope protein that is regulated as a gamma 1 gene. Two-hybrid and pulldown assays demonstrated that UL20, but no other HSV-1 gene-encoded proteins, binds specifically to GODZ (also known as DHHC3), a cellular Golgi apparatus-specific Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) zinc finger protein. A catalytically inactive dominant-negative GODZ construct significantly reduced HSV-1 replication in vitro and affected the localization of UL20 and glycoprotein K (gK) and their interactions but not glycoprotein C (gC). GODZ is involved in palmitoylation, and we found that UL20 is palmitoylated by GODZ using a GODZ dominant-negative plasmid. Blocking of palmitoylation using 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) affected the virus titer and the interaction of UL20 and gK but did not affect the levels of these proteins. In conclusion, we have shown that binding of UL20 to GODZ in the Golgi apparatus regulates trafficking of UL20 and its subsequent effects on gK localization and virus replication. We also have demonstrated that GODZ-mediated UL20 palmitoylation is critical for UL20 membrane targeting and thus gK cell surface expression, providing new mechanistic insights into how UL20 palmitoylation regulates HSV-1 infectivity.
   IMPORTANCE HSV-1 UL20 is a nonglycosylated essential envelope protein that is highly conserved among herpesviruses. In this study, we show that (i) HSV-1 UL20 binds to GODZ (also known as DHHC3), a Golgi apparatus-specific Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) zinc finger protein; (ii) a GODZ dominant-negative mutant and an inhibitor of palmitoylation reduced HSV-1 titers and altered the localization of UL20 and glycoprotein K; and (iii) UL20 is palmitoylated by GODZ, and this UL20 palmitoylation is required for HSV-1 infectivity. Thus, blocking of the interaction of UL20 with GODZ, using a GODZ dominant-negative mutant or possibly GODZ shRNA, should be considered a potential alternative therapy in not only HSV-1 but also other conditions in which GODZ processing is an integral component of pathogenesis.

AB Like other enteroviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) relies on phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KB) for genome RNA replication. However, how PI4KB is recruited to the genome replication sites of EV71 remains elusive. Recently, we reported that a host factor, ACBD3, is needed for EV71 replication by interacting with viral 3A protein. Here, we show that ACBD3 is required for the recruitment of PI4KB to RNA replication sites. Overexpression of viral 3A or EV71 infection stimulates the interaction of PI4KB and ACBD3. Consistently, EV71 infection induces the production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). Furthermore, PI4KB, ACBD3, and 3A are all localized to the viral-RNA replication sites. Accordingly, PI4KB or ACBD3 depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to a reduction in PI4P production after EV71 infection. I44A or H54Y substitution in 3A interrupts the stimulation of PI4KB and ACBD3. Further analysis suggests that stimulation of ACBD3-PI4KB interaction is also important for the replication of enterovirus 68 but disadvantageous to human rhinovirus 16. These results reveal a mechanism of enterovirus replication that involves a selective strategy for recruitment of PI4KB to the RNA replication sites.
   IMPORTANCE Enterovirus 71, like other human enteroviruses, replicates its genome within host cells, where viral proteins efficiently utilize cellular machineries. While multiple factors are involved, it is largely unclear how viral replication is controlled. We show that the 3A protein of enterovirus 71 recruits an enzyme, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta, by interacting with ACBD3, which alters cellular membranes through the production of a lipid, PI4P. Consequently, the viral and host proteins form a large complex that is necessary for RNA synthesis at replication sites. Notably, PI4KB-ACBD3 interaction also differentially mediates the replication of enterovirus 68 and rhinovirus 16. These results provide new insight into the molecular network of enterovirus replication.

AB Lassa virus (LASV) is an enveloped RNA virus endemic to West Africa and responsible for severe cases of hemorrhagic fever. Virus entry is mediated by the glycoprotein complex consisting of a stable-signal peptide, a receptor-binding subunit, GP1,and a viral-host membrane fusion subunit, GP2. Several cellular receptors can interact with the GP1 subunit and mediate viral entry, including alpha-dystroglycan (alpha DG) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1). In order to define the regions within GP1 that interact with the cellular receptors, we implemented insertional mutagenesis, carbohydrate shielding, and alanine scanning mutagenesis. Eighty GP constructs were engineered and evaluated for GP1-GP2 processing, surface expression, and the ability to mediate cell-to-cell fusion after low-pH exposure. To examine virus-to-cell entry, 49 constructs were incorporated onto vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticles and transduction efficiencies were monitored in HAP1 and HAP1-triangle DAG1 cells that differentially produce the alpha DG cell surface receptor. Seven constructs retained efficient transduction in HAP1-DAG1 cells yet poorly transduced HAP1 cells, suggesting that they are involved in alpha DG utilization. Residues H141, N146, F147, and Y150 cluster at the predicted central core of the trimeric interface and are important for GP-alpha DG interaction. Additionally, H92A-H93A, 150HA, 172HA, and 230HA displayed reduced transduction in both HAP1 and HAP1-DAG1 cells, despite efficient cell-to-cell fusion activity. These mutations may interfere with interactions with the endosomal receptor LAMP1 or interfere at another stage in entry that is common to both cell lines. Insight gained from these data can aid in the development of more-effective entry inhibitors by blocking receptor interactions.
   IMPORTANCE Countries in which Lassa virus is endemic, such as Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, usually experience a seasonal outbreak of the virus from December to March. Currently, there is neither a preventative vaccine nor a therapeutic available to effectively treat severe Lassa fever. One way to thwart virus infection is to inhibit interaction with cellular receptors. It is known that the GP1 subunit of the Lassa glycoprotein complex plays a critical role in receptor recognition. Our results highlight a region within the Lassa virus GP1 protein that interacts with the cellular receptor alpha-dystroglycan. This information may be used for future development of new Lassa virus antivirals.

AB V3-glycan-targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are a focus of HIV-1 vaccine development. Understanding the viral dynamics that stimulate the development of these antibodies can provide insights for immunogen design. We used a deep-sequencing approach, together with neutralization phenotyping, to investigate the rate and complexity of escape from V3-glycan-directed bNAbs compared to overlapping early strain-specific neutralizing antibody (ssNAb) responses to the V3/C3 region in donor CAP177. Escape from the ssNAb response occurred rapidly via an N334-to-N332 glycan switch, which took just 7.5 weeks to reach >50% frequency. In contrast, escape from the bNAbs was mediated via multiple pathways and took longer, with escape first occurring through an increase in V1 loop length, which took 46 weeks to reach 50% frequency, followed by an N332-to-N334 reversion, which took 66 weeks. Importantly, bNAb escape was incomplete, with contemporaneous neutralization observed up to 3 years postinfection. Both the ssNAb response and the bNAb response were modulated by the presence/absence of the N332 glycan, indicating an overlap between the two epitopes. Thus, selective pressure by ssNAbs to maintain the N332 glycan may have constrained the bNAb escape pathway. This slower and incomplete viral escape resulted in prolonged exposure of the bNAb epitope, which may in turn have aided the maturation of the bNAb lineage.
   IMPORTANCE The development of an HIV-1 vaccine is of paramount importance, and broadly neutralizing antibodies are likely to be a key component of a protective vaccine. The V3-glycan-targeting bNAb responses are among the most promising vaccine targets, as they are commonly elicited during infection. Understanding the interplay between viral evolution and the development of these antibodies provides insights that may guide immunogen design. Our work contrasted the dynamics of the early strain-specific antibodies and the later broadly neutralizing responses to a common Env target (V3C3), showing slower and more complex escape from bNAbs. virus neutralization, supports the proposal that prolonged exposure of the bNAb epitope enabled the maturation of the bNAb lineage.

AB Syncytin genes are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been exapted for a role in placentation. They are involved in the formation of a syncytial structure (the syncytiotrophoblast) at the fetomaternal interface via their fusogenic activity. The mouse placenta is unique among placental mammals since the fetomaternal interface comprises two syncytiotrophoblast layers (ST-I and ST-II) instead of one, as observed in humans and all other hemochorial placentae. Each layer specifically expresses a distinct mouse syncytin, namely, syncytin-A (SynA) for ST-I and syncytin-B (SynB) for ST-II, which have been shown to be essential to placentogenesis and embryo survival. Their cognate cellular receptors, which are necessary to mediate cell-cell fusion and syncytiotrophoblast formation, are still unknown. By devising a sensitive method that combines a cell-cell fusion assay with the screening of a mouse cDNA library, we succeeded in identifying the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein lymphocyte antigen 6E (Ly6e) as a candidate receptor for SynA. Transfection of cells with the cloned receptor led to their fusion to cells expressing SynA, with no cross-reactive fusion activity with SynB. Knocking down Ly6e greatly reduced SynA-induced cell fusion, thus suggesting that Ly6e is the sole receptor for SynA in vivo. Interaction of SynA with Ly6e was further demonstrated by a competition assay using the soluble ectodomain of Ly6e. Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of Ly6e expression on a representative panel of mouse tissues shows that it is significantly expressed in the mouse placenta together with SynA.
   IMPORTANCE Syncytin genes are envelope genes of endogenous retroviruses, coopted for a physiological function in placentation. Syncytins are fusogenic proteins that mediate cell-cell fusion by interacting with receptors present on the partner cells. Here, by devising a sensitive in vitro fusion assay that enables the high-throughput screening of normalized cDNA libraries, we identified the long-sought receptor for syncytin-A (SynA), a mouse syncytin responsible for syncytiotrophoblast formation at the maternofetal interface of the mouse placenta. This protein, Ly6e (lymphocyte antigen 6E), is a GPI-anchored membrane protein, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments targeting its deletion as well as a decoy assay using a recombinant soluble receptor show that Ly6e is the necessary and sufficient partner of SynA. Its profile of expression is consistent with a role in both ancestral endogenization of a SynA founder retrovirus and present-day placenta formation. This study provides a powerful general method to identify genes involved in cell-cell fusion processes.

AB Prime-boost vaccination strategies against HIV-1 often include multiple variants for a given immunogen for better coverage of the extensive viral diversity. To study the immunologic effects of this approach, we characterized breadth, phenotype, function, and specificity of Gag-specific T cells induced by a DNA-prime modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-boost vaccination strategy, which uses mismatched Gag immunogens in the TamoVac 01 phase IIa trial. Healthy Tanzanian volunteers received three injections of the DNA-SMI vaccine encoding a subtype B and AB-recombinant Gag(p37) and two vaccinations with MVA-CMDR encoding subtype A Gag(p55). Gag-specific T-cell responses were studied in 42 vaccinees using fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After the first MVA-CMDR boost, vaccine-induced gamma interferon-positive (IFN-gamma(+)) Gag-specific T-cell responses were dominated by CD4(+) T cells (P < 0.001 compared to CD8(+) T cells) that coexpressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) (66.4%) and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (63.7%). A median of 3 antigenic regions were targeted with a higher-magnitude median response to Gag(p24) regions, more conserved between prime and boost, compared to those of regions within Gag(p15) (not primed) and Gag(p17) (less conserved; P < 0.0001 for both). Four regions within Gag(p24) each were targeted by 45% to 74% of vaccinees upon restimulation with DNA-SMI-Gag matched peptides. The response rate to individual antigenic regions correlated with the sequence homology between the MVA- and DNA Gag-encoded immunogens (P = 0.04, r(2) = 0.47). In summary, after the first MVA-CMDR boost, the sequence-mismatched DNA-prime MVA-boost vaccine strategy induced a Gag-specific T-cell response that was dominated by polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells and that targeted multiple antigenic regions within the conserved Gag(p24) protein.
   IMPORTANCE Genetic diversity is a major challenge for the design of vaccines against variable viruses. While including multiple variants for a given immunogen in prime-boost vaccination strategies is one approach that aims to improve coverage for global virus variants, the immunologic consequences of this strategy have been poorly defined so far. It is unclear whether inclusion of multiple variants in prime-boost vaccination strategies improves recognition of variant viruses by T cells and by which mechanisms this would be achieved, either by improved cross-recognition of multiple variants for a given antigenic region or through preferential targeting of antigenic regions more conserved between prime and boost. Engineering vaccines to induce adaptive immune responses that preferentially target conserved antigenic regions of viral vulnerability might facilitate better immune control after preventive and therapeutic vaccination for HIV and for other variable viruses.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) primarily infects hepatocytes, which are highly polarized cells. The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed only in distantly related models and remains poorly understood. Although polarized epithelial cells have a rather simple morphology with a basolateral and an apical domain, hepatocytes exhibit complex polarization structures. However, it has been reported that some selected polarized HepG2 cell clones can exhibit a honeycomb pattern of distribution of the tight-junction proteins typical of columnar polarized epithelia, which can be used as a simple model to study the role of cell polarization in viral infection of hepatocytes. To obtain similar clones, HepG2 cells expressing CD81 (HepG2-CD81) were used, and clones were isolated by limiting dilutions. Two clones exhibiting a simple columnar polarization capacity when grown on a semipermeable support were isolated and characterized. To test the polarity of HCV entry and release, our polarized HepG2-CD81 clones were infected with cell culture-derived HCV. Our data indicate that HCV binds equally to both sides of the cells, but productive infection occurs mainly when the virus is added at the basolateral domain. Furthermore, we also observed that HCV virions are released from the basolateral domain of the cells. Finally, when polarized cells were treated with oleic acid and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, to promote lipoprotein secretion, a higher proportion of infectious viral particles of lower density were secreted. This cell culture system provides an excellent model to investigate the influence of cell polarization on the HCV life cycle.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C is a major health burden, with approximately 170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) primarily infects hepatocytes, which are highly polarized cells with a complex organization. The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed in distantly related models and remains unclear. Hepatocyte organization is complex, with multiple apical and basolateral surfaces. A simple culture model of HepG2 cells expressing CD81 that are able to polarize with unique apical and basolateral domains was developed to study HCV infection. With this model, we demonstrated that HCV enters and exits hepatocytes by the basolateral domain. Furthermore, lower-density viral particles were produced under conditions that promote lipoprotein secretion. This cell culture system provides a useful model to study the influence of cell polarization on HCV infection.

Viral components target subcellular organelles to access host machineries required for replication and spread. Diverse viruses are known to alter organelle shape, composition, function, and dynamics as part of their replication cycles. Here, we highlight recent advances in microscopy and proteomic methods that have helped and will continue to help define mechanisms used by viruses to exploit host proteome organization.

AB Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the Filoviridae family, is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and is responsible for epidemics throughout sub-Saharan, central, and West Africa. The EBOV genome encodes VP35, an important viral protein involved in virus replication by acting as an essential cofactor of the viral polymerase as well as a potent antagonist of the host antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) system. By using mass spectrometry analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show here that VP35 is ubiquitinated on lysine 309 (K309), a residue located on its IFN antagonist domain. We also found that VP35 interacts with TRIM6, a member of the E3-ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM) family. We recently reported that TRIM6 promotes the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not covalently attached to any protein, to induce efficient antiviral IFN-I-mediated responses. Consistent with this notion, VP35 also associated noncovalently with polyubiquitin chains and inhibited TRIM6-mediated IFN-I induction. Intriguingly, we also found that TRIM6 enhances EBOV polymerase activity in a minigenome assay and TRIM6 knockout cells have reduced replication of infectious EBOV, suggesting that VP35 hijacks TRIM6 to promote EBOV replication through ubiquitination. Our work provides evidence that TRIM6 is an important host cellular factor that promotes EBOV replication, and future studies will focus on whether TRIM6 could be targeted for therapeutic intervention against EBOV infection.
   IMPORTANCE EBOV belongs to a family of highly pathogenic viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals with high mortality rates (40 to 90%). Because of its high pathogenicity and lack of licensed antivirals and vaccines, EBOV is listed as a tier 1 select-agent risk group 4 pathogen. An important mechanism for the severity of EBOV infection is its suppression of innate immune responses. The EBOV VP35 protein contributes to pathogenesis, because it serves as an essential cofactor of the viral polymerase as well as a potent antagonist of innate immunity. However, how VP35 function is regulated by host cellular factors is poorly understood. Here, we report that the host E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM6 promotes VP35 ubiquitination and is important for efficient virus replication. Therefore, our study identifies a new host factor, TRIM6, as a potential target in the development of antiviral drugs against EBOV.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA hepatotropic virus. Despite cellular defenses, HCV is able to replicate in hepatocytes and to establish a chronic infection that could lead to severe complications and hepatocellular carcinoma. An important player in subverting the host response to HCV infection is the viral nonstructural protein NS5A, which, in addition to its role in replication and assembly, targets several pathways involved in the cellular response to viral infection. Several unbiased screens identified nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1) as an interaction partner of HCV NS5A. Here we confirmed this interaction and mapped it to the C terminus of NS5A of both genotype 1 and 2. NS5A sequesters NAP1L1 in the cytoplasm, blocking its nuclear translocation. However, only NS5A from genotype 2 HCV, and not that from genotype 1, targets NAP1L1 for proteosome-mediated degradation. NAP1L1 is a nuclear chaperone involved in chromatin remodeling, and we demonstrated the NAP1L1-dependent regulation of specific pathways involved in cellular responses to viral infection and cell survival. Among those, we showed that lack of NAP1L1 leads to a decrease of RELA protein levels and a strong defect of IRF3 TBK1/IKK epsilon-mediated phosphorylation, leading to inefficient RIG-I and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) responses. Hence, HCV is able to modulate the host cell environment by targeting NAP1L1 through NS5A.
   IMPORTANCE Viruses have evolved to replicate and to overcome antiviral countermeasures of the infected cell. Hepatitis C virus is capable of establishing a lifelong chronic infection in the liver, which could develop into cirrhosis and cancer. Chronic viruses are particularly able to interfere with the cellular antiviral pathways by several different mechanisms. In this study, we identified a novel cellular target of the viral nonstructural protein NS5A and demonstrated its role in antiviral signaling. This factor, called nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1), is a nuclear chaperone involved in the remodeling of chromatin during transcription. When it is depleted, specific signaling pathways leading to antiviral effectors are affected. Therefore, we provide evidence for both a novel strategy of virus evasion from cellular immunity and a novel role for a cellular protein, which has not been described to date.

TI The Nucleocapsid Protein and Nonstructural Protein 10 of Highly

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is a panzootic disease that is one of the most economically costly diseases to the swine industry. A key aspect of PRRSV virulence is that the virus suppresses the innate immune response and induces persistent infection, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The dendritic cell (DC) marker CD83 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is associated with DC activation and immunosuppression of T cell proliferation when expressed as soluble CD83 (sCD83). In this study, we show that PRRSV infection strongly stimulates CD83 expression in porcine monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) and that the nucleocapsid (N) protein and nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) of PRRSV enhance CD83 promoter activity via the NF-kappa B and Sp1 signaling pathways. R43A and K44A amino acid substitution mutants of the N protein suppress the N protein-mediated increase of CD83 promoter activity. Similarly, P192-5A and G214-3A mutants of nsp10 (with 5 and 3 alanine substitutions beginning at residues P192 and G214, respectively) abolish the nsp10-mediated induction of the CD83 promoter. Using reverse genetics, four mutant viruses (rR43A, rK44A, rP192-5A, and rG214-3A) and four revertants [rR43A(R), rK44A(R), rP192-5A(R), and rG214-3A(R)] were generated. Decreased induction of CD83 in MoDCs was observed after infection by mutants rR43A, rK44A, rP192-5A, and rG214-3A, in contrast to the results obtained using rR43A(R), rK44A(R), rP192-5A(R), and rG214-3A(R). These findings suggest that PRRSV N and nsp10 play important roles in modulating CD83 signaling and shed light on the mechanism by which PRRSV modulates host immunity.
   IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically costly pathogens affecting the swine industry. It is unclear how PRRSV inhibits the host's immune response and induces persistent infection. The dendritic cell (DC) marker CD83 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and has previously been associated with DC activation and immunosuppression of T cell proliferation and differentiation when expressed as soluble CD83 (sCD83). In this study, we found that PRRSV infection induces sCD83 expression in porcine MoDCs via the NF-kappa B and Sp1 signaling pathways. The viral nucleocapsid protein, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), and nsp10 were shown to enhance CD83 promoter activity. Amino acids R43 and K44 of the N protein, as well as residues 192 to 196 (P192-5) and 214 to 216 (G214-3) of nsp10, play important roles in CD83 promoter activation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of immune suppression by PRRSV.

AB Mitochondria are crucial to proper neuronal function and overall brain health. Mitochondrial dysfunction within the brain has been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including prion disease. Several markers of decreased mitochondrial activity during prion infection have been reported, yet the bioenergetic respiratory status of mitochondria from prion-infected animals is unknown. Here we show that clinically ill transgenic mice overexpressing hamster prion protein (Tg7) infected with the hamster prion strain 263K suffer from a severe deficit in mitochondrial oxygen consumption in response to the respiratory complex II substrate succinate. Characterization of the mitochondrial proteome of purified brain mitochondria from infected and uninfected Tg7 mice showed significant differences in the relative abundance of key mitochondrial electron transport proteins in 263K-infected animals relative to that in controls. Our results suggest that at clinical stages of prion infection, dysregulation of respiratory chain proteins may lead to impairment of mitochondrial respiration in the brain.
   IMPORTANCE Mitochondrial dysfunction is present in most major neurodegenerative diseases, and some studies have suggested that mitochondrial processes may be altered during prion disease. Here we show that hamster prion-infected transgenic mice overexpressing the hamster prion protein (Tg7 mice) suffer from mitochondrial respiratory deficits. Tg7 mice infected with the 263K hamster prion strain have little or no signs of mitochondrial dysfunction at the disease midpoint but suffer from a severe deficit in mitochondrial respiration at the clinical phase of disease. A proteomic analysis of the isolated brain mitochondria from clinically affected animals showed that several proteins involved in electron transport, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial protein synthesis were dysregulated. These results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly exacerbated by prion protein overexpression, occurs at late stages during 263K prion disease and that this dysfunction may be the result of dysregulation of mitochondrial proteins.

AB Rhesus macaques are used to model human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections, but they are not natural hosts of HIV-1 or any simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Rather, they became infected with SIV through cross-species transfer from sooty mangabeys in captivity. It has been shown that HIV-1 utilizes rhesus CD4 less efficiently than human CD4. However, the relative ability of SIV envelope glycoproteins to bind or utilize these CD4 orthologs has not been reported. Here we show that several SIV isolates, including SIVmac239, are more efficiently neutralized by human CD4-Ig (huCD4-Ig) than by the same molecule bearing rhesus CD4 domains 1 and 2 (rhCD4-Ig). An I39N mutation in CD4 domain 1, present in human and sooty mangabey CD4 orthologs, largely restored rhCD4-Ig neutralization of SIVmac239 and other SIV isolates. We further observed that SIVmac316, a derivative of SIVmac239, bound to and was neutralized by huCD4-Ig and rhCD4-Ig with nearly identical efficiencies. Introduction of two SIVmac316 CD4-binding site residues (G382R and H442Y) into the SIVmac239 envelope glycoprotein (Env) markedly increased its neutralization sensitivity to rhesus CD4-Ig without altering neutralization by human CD4-Ig, SIV neutralizing antibodies, or sera from SIV-infected macaques. These changes also allowed SIVmac239 Env to bind rhCD4-Ig more efficiently than huCD4-Ig. The variant with G382R and H442Y (G382R/H442Y variant) also infected cells expressing rhesus CD4 with markedly greater efficiency than did unaltered SIVmac239 Env. We propose that infections of rhesus macaques with SIVmac239 G382R/H442Y might better model some aspects of human infections.
   IMPORTANCE Rhesus macaque infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) has served as an important model of human HIV-1 infection. However, differences between this model and the human case have complicated the development of vaccines and therapies. Here we report the surprising observation that SIVmac239, a commonly used model virus, more efficiently utilizes human CD4 than the CD4 of rhesus macaques, whereas the closely related virus SIVmac316 uses both CD4 orthologs equally well. We used this insight to generate a form of SIVmac239 envelope glycoprotein (Env) that utilized rhesus CD4 more efficiently, while retaining its resistance to antibodies and sera from infected macaques. This Env can be used to make the rhesus model more similar in some ways to human infection, for example by facilitating infection of cells with low levels of CD4. This property may be especially important to efforts to eradicate latently infected cells.

AB The mumps virus (MuV) small hydrophobic protein (SH) is a type I membrane protein expressed in infected cells. SH has been reported to interfere with innate immunity by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we generated recombinant MuVs (rMuVs) expressing the SH protein with an N-terminal FLAG epitope or lacking SH expression due to the insertion of three stop codons into the SH gene. Using these viruses, we were able to show that SH reduces the phosphorylation of IKK beta, I kappa B alpha, and p65 as well as the translocation of p65 into the nucleus of infected A549 cells. Reporter gene assays revealed that SH interferes not only with TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa B activation but also with IL-1 beta-and poly(I.C)-mediated NF-kappa B activation, and that this inhibition occurs upstream of the NF-kappa B pathway components TRAF2, TRAF6, and TAK1. Since SH coimmunoprecipitated with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), RIP1, and IRAK1, we hypothesize that SH exerts its inhibitory function by interacting with TNFR1, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), and TLR3 complexes in the plasma membrane of infected cells.
   IMPORTANCE The MuV SH has been shown to impede TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa B activation and is therefore thought to contribute to viral immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which SH mediates NF-kappa B inhibition remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that SH interacts with TNFR1, IL-1R1, and TLR3 complexes in infected cells. We thereby not only shed light on the mechanisms of SH-mediated NF-kappa B inhibition but also reveal that SH interferes with NF-kappa B activation induced by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and double-stranded RNA.

AB Diarrhea is the major cause of non-research-associated morbidity and mortality affecting the supply of rhesus macaques and, potentially, their responses to experimental treatments. Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) in rhesus macaques also resembles ulcerative colitis, one form of human inflammatory bowel disease. To test for viral etiologies, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes from 32 healthy animals, 31 animals with acute diarrhea, and 29 animals with ICD. The overall fractions of eukaryotic viral reads were 0.063% for the healthy group, 0.131% for the acute-diarrhea group, and 0.297% for the chronic-diarrhea group. Eukaryotic viruses belonging to 6 viral families, as well as numerous circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS DNA) viral genomes, were identified. The most commonly detected sequences were from picornaviruses, making up 59 to 88% of all viral reads, followed by 9 to 17% for CRESS DNA virus sequences. The remaining 5 virus families, Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Anelloviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Parvoviridae, collectively made up 1 to 3% of the viral reads, except for parvoviruses, which made up 23% of the viral reads in the healthy group. Detected members of the families Picornaviridae and Parvoviridae were highly diverse, consisting of multiple genera, species, and genotypes. Coinfections with members of up to six viral families were detected. Complete and partial viral genomes were assembled and used to measure the number of matching short sequence reads in feces from the 92 animals in the two clinical and the healthy control groups. Several enterovirus genotypes and CRESS DNA genomes were associated with ICD relative to healthy animals. Conversely, higher read numbers from different parvoviruses were associated with healthy animals. Our study reveals a high level of enteric coinfections with diverse viruses in a captive rhesus macaque colony and identifies several viruses positively or negatively associated with ICD.

AB The Western Reserve (WR) strain of mature vaccinia virus contains an A26 envelope protein that mediates virus binding to cell surface laminin and subsequent endocytic entry into HeLa cells. Removal of the A26 protein from the WR strain mature virus generates a mutant, WR Delta A26, that enters HeLa cells through plasma membrane fusion. Here, we infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with wild-type strain WR and the WR Delta A26 mutant and analyzed viral gene expression and cellular innate immune signaling. In contrast to previous studies, in which both HeLa cells infected with WR and HeLa cells infected with WR Delta A26 expressed abundant viral late proteins, we found that WR expressed much less viral late protein than WR Delta A26 in BMDM. Microarray analysis of the cellular transcripts in BMDM induced by virus infection revealed that WR preferentially activated type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent signaling but WR Delta A26 did not. We consistently detected a higher level of soluble beta interferon secretion and phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein in BMDM infected with WR than in BMDM infected with WR Delta A26. When IFNAR-knockout BMDM were infected with WR, late viral protein expression increased, confirming that IFNAR-dependent signaling was differentially induced by WR and, in turn, restricted viral late gene expression. Finally, wildtype C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible to mortality from WR Delta A26 infection than to that from WR infection, whereas IFNAR-knockout mice were equally susceptible to WR and WR Delta A26 infection, demonstrating that the ability of WR Delta A26 to evade IFNAR signaling has an important influence on viral pathogenesis in vivo.
   IMPORTANCE The vaccinia virus A26 protein was previously shown to mediate virus attachment and to regulate viral endocytosis. Here, we show that infection with strain WR induces a robust innate immune response that activates type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent cellular genes in BMDM, whereas infection with the WR Delta A26 mutant does not. We further demonstrated that the differential activation of IFNAR-dependent cellular signaling between WR and WR Delta A26 not only is important for differential host restriction in BMDM but also is important for viral virulence in vivo. Our study reveals a new property of WR Delta A26, which is in regulating host antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo.

AB Progressive T cell depletion during chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection is a key mechanism that leads to the development of AIDS. Recent studies have suggested that most T cells in the tissue die through pyroptosis triggered by abortive infection, i.e., infection of resting T cells in which HIV failed to complete reverse transcription. However, the contribution of abortive infection to T cell loss and how quickly abortively infected cells die in vivo, key parameters for a quantitative understanding of T cell population dynamics, are not clear. Here, we infected rhesus macaques with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) and followed the dynamics of both plasma SHIV RNA and total cell-associated SHIV DNA. Fitting mathematical models to the data, we estimate that upon infection a majority of CD4(+) T cells (approximately 65%, on average) become abortively infected and die at a relatively high rate of 0.27 day (-1) (half-life, 2.6 days). This confirms the importance of abortive infection in driving T cell depletion. Further, we find evidence suggesting that an immune response may be restricting viral infection 1 to 3 weeks after infection. Our study serves as a step forward toward a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms driving T cell depletion during HIV infection.
   IMPORTANCE In HIV-infected patients, progressive CD4(+) T cell loss ultimately leads to the development of AIDS. The mechanisms underlying this T cell loss are not clear. Recent experimental data suggest that the majority of CD4(+) T cells in tissue die through abortive infection, where the accumulation of incomplete HIV transcripts triggers cell death. To investigate the role of abortive infection in driving CD4(+) T cell loss in vivo, we infected macaques with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) and followed the viral kinetics of both plasma RNA and cell-associated DNA during infection. Fitting mathematical models, we estimated that a large fraction of infected cells dies through abortive infection and has a half-life of approximately 2.6 days. Our results provide the first in vivo quantitative estimates of parameters characterizing abortive infection and support the notion that abortive infection represents an important mechanism underlying progressive CD4(+) T cell depletion in vivo.

AB VP26 is a herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) small capsomere-interacting protein. In this study, we investigated the function of VP26 in HSV-1-infected cells with the following results. (i) The VP26 null mutation significantly impaired incorporation of minor capsid protein UL25 into nucleocapsids (type C capsids) in the nucleus. (ii) The VP26 mutation caused improper localization of UL25 in discrete punctate domains containing multiple capsid proteins (e.g., the VP5 major capsid protein) in the nucleus; these domains corresponded to capsid aggregates. (iii) The VP26 mutation significantly impaired packaging of replicated viral DNA genomes into capsids but had no effect on viral DNA concatemer cleavage. (iv) The VP26 mutation reduced the frequency of type C capsids, which contain viral DNA but not scaffolding proteins, and produced an accumulation of type A capsids, which lack both viral DNA and scaffold proteins, and had no effect on accumulation of type B capsids, which lack viral DNA but retain cleaved scaffold proteins. Collectively, these results indicated that VP26 was required for efficient viral DNA packaging and proper localization of nuclear capsids. The phenotype of the VP26 null mutation was similar to that reported previously of the UL25 null mutation and of UL25 mutations that preclude UL25 binding to capsids. Thus, VP26 appeared to regulate nucleocapsid maturation by promoting incorporation of UL25 into capsids, which is likely to be required for proper capsid nuclear localization.
   IMPORTANCE HSV-1 VP26 has been reported to be important for viral replication and virulence in cell cultures and/or mouse models. However, little is known about the function of VP26 during HSV-1 replication, in particular, in viral nucleocapsid maturation although HSV-1 nucleocapsids are estimated to contain 900 copies of VP26. In this study, we present data suggesting that VP26 promoted packaging of HSV-1 DNA genomes into capsids by regulating incorporation of capsid protein UL25 into capsids, which was reported to increase stability of the capsid structure. We also showed that VP26 was required for proper localization of capsids in the infected cell nucleus. This is the first report showing that HSV-1 VP26 is a regulator for nucleocapsid maturation.

AB Enterovirus 71 (EV71) can cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in young children. Severe infection with EV71 can lead to neurological complications and even death. However, the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we report that EV71 induces degradation of gasdermin D (GSDMD), an essential component of pyroptosis. Remarkably, the viral protease 3C directly targets GSDMD and induces its cleavage, which is dependent on the protease activity. Further analyses show that the Q193-G194 pair within GSDMD is the cleavage site of 3C. This cleavage produces a shorter N-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1 to 193 (GSDMD(1-193)). However, unlike the N-terminal fragment produced by caspase-1 cleavage, this fragment fails to trigger cell death or inhibit EV71 replication. Importantly, a T239D or F240D substitution abrogates the activity of GSDMD consisting of amino acids 1 to 275 (GSDMD(1-275)). This is correlated with the lack of pyroptosis or inhibition of viral replication. These results reveal a previously unrecognized strategy for EV71 to evade the antiviral response.
   IMPORTANCE Recently, it has been reported that GSDMD plays a critical role in regulating lipopolysaccharide and NLRP3-mediated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) secretion. In this process, the N-terminal domain of p30 released from GSDMD acts as an effector in cell pyroptosis. We show that EV71 infection downregulates GSDMD. EV71 3C cleaves GSDMD at the Q193-G194 pair, resulting in a truncated N-terminal fragment disrupted for inducing cell pyroptosis. Notably, GSDMD(1-275) (p30) inhibits EV71 replication whereas GSDMD(1-193) does not. These results reveal a new strategy for EV71 to evade the antiviral response.

AB Studying HIV-infected individuals who control HIV replication (elite controllers [ECs]) enables exploration of effective anti-HIV immunity. HIV Env-specific and non-Env-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may contribute to protection from progressive HIV infection, but the evidence is limited. We recruited 22 ECs and matched them with 44 viremic subjects. HIV Env-and Vpu-specific ADCC responses in sera were studied using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based dimeric recombinant soluble Fc gamma RIIIa (rsFc gamma RIIIa)-binding assay, surface plasmon resonance, antibody-dependent natural killer (NK) cell activation assays, and ADCC-mediated killing assays. ECs had higher levels of HIV Env-specific antibodies capable of binding Fc gamma RIIIa, activating NK cells, and mediating granzyme B activity (all P < 0.01) than viremic subjects. ECs also had higher levels of antibodies against a C-terminal 13-mer Vpu peptide capable of mediating Fc gamma RIIIa binding and NK cell activation than viremic subjects (both P < 0.05). Our data associate Env-specific and Vpu epitope-specific ADCC in effective immune responses against HIV among ECs. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of ADCC in HIV control.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding immune responses associated with elite control of HIV may aid the development of immunotherapeutic and vaccine strategies for controlling HIV infection. Env is a major HIV protein target of functional antibody responses that are heightened in ECs. Interestingly, EC antibodies also target Vpu, an accessory protein crucial to HIV, which degrades CD4 and antagonizes tetherin. Antibodies specific to Vpu are a common feature of the immune response of ECs that may prove to be of functional importance to the design of improved ADCC-based immunotherapy and preventative HIV vaccines.

AB Autophagy is an essential metabolic program that is also used for clearing intracellular pathogens. This mechanism, also termed selective autophagy, is well characterized for invasive bacteria but remains poorly documented for viral infections. Here we highlight our recent work showing that endosomolytic adenoviruses trigger autophagy when entering cells. Our study revealed how adenoviruses exploit a capsid-associated small PPxY peptide motif to manipulate the autophagic machinery to prevent autophagic degradation and to promote endosomal escape and nuclear trafficking.

AB There are no approved therapeutics for the treatment of dengue disease despite the global prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) and its mosquito vectors. DENV infections can lead to vascular complications, hemorrhage, and shock due to the ability of DENV to infect a variety of immune and nonimmune cell populations. Increasingly, studies have implicated the host response as a major contributor to severe disease. Inflammatory products of various cell types, including responding T cells, mast cells (MCs), and infected monocytes, can contribute to immune pathology. In this study, we show that the host response to DENV infection in immunocompetent mice recapitulates transcriptional changes that have been described in human studies. We found that DENV infection strongly induced metabolic dysregulation, complement signaling, and inflammation. DENV also affected the immune cell content of the spleen and liver, enhancing NK, NKT, and CD8(+) T cell activation. The MC-stabilizing drug ketotifen reversed many of these responses without suppressing memory T cell formation and induced additional changes in the transcriptome and immune cell composition of the spleen, consistent with reduced inflammation. This study provides a global transcriptional map of immune activation in DENV target organs of an immunocompetent host and supports the further development of targeted immunomodulatory strategies to treat DENV disease.
   IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV), which causes febrile illness, is transmitted by mosquito vectors throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Symptoms of DENV infection involve damage to blood vessels and, in rare cases, hemorrhage and shock. Currently, there are no targeted therapies to treat DENV infection, but it is thought that drugs that target the host immune response may be effective in limiting symptoms that result from excessive inflammation. In this study, we measured the host transcriptional response to infection in multiple DENV target organs using a mouse model of disease. We found that DENV infection induced metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory responses and affected the immune cell content of the spleen and liver. The use of the mast cell stabilization drug ketotifen reversed many of these responses and induced additional changes in the transcriptome and immune cell repertoire that contribute to decreased dengue disease.

TI Single-Particle Detection of Transcription following Rotavirus Entry

DE RNA synthesis; fluorescence microscopy; rhesus rotavirus; virus entry
ID REPLICATION; PROTEIN; RNA; VIROPLASMS; MICROSCOPY; RESOLUTION;
   COMPLEXES; SPIKE
AB Infectious rotavirus particles are triple-layered, icosahedral assemblies. The outer layer proteins, VP4 (cleaved to VP8* and VP5*) and VP7, surround a transcriptionally competent, double-layer particle (DLP), which they deliver into the cytosol. During entry of rhesus rotavirus, VP8* interacts with cell surface gangliosides, allowing engulfment into a membrane vesicle by a clathrin-independent process. Escape into the cytosol and outer-layer shedding depend on interaction of a hydrophobic surface on VP5* with the membrane bilayer and on a large-scale conformational change. We report here experiments that detect the fate of released DLPs and their efficiency in initiating RNA synthesis. By replacing the outer layer with fluorescently tagged, recombinant proteins and also tagging the DLP, we distinguished particles that have lost their outer layer and entered the cytosol (uncoated) from those still within membrane vesicles. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes for nascent transcripts to determine how soon after uncoating transcription began and what fraction of the uncoated particles were active in initiating RNA synthesis. We detected RNA synthesis by uncoated particles as early as 15 min after adding virus. The uncoating efficiency was 20 to 50%; of the uncoated particles, about 10 to 15% synthesized detectable RNA. In the format of our experiments, about 10% of the added particles attached to the cell surface, giving an overall ratio of added particles to RNA-synthesizing particles of between 250: 1 and 500: 1, in good agreement with the ratio of particles to focus-forming units determined by infectivity assays. Thus, RNA synthesis by even a single, uncoated particle can initiate infection in a cell.
   IMPORTANCE The pathways by which a virus enters a cell transform its packaged genome into an active one. Contemporary fluorescence microscopy can detect individual virus particles as they enter cells, allowing us to map their multistep entry pathways. Rotaviruses, like most viruses that lack membranes of their own, disrupt or perforate the intracellular, membrane-enclosed compartment into which they become engulfed following attachment to a cell surface, in order to gain access to the cell interior. The properties of rotavirus particles make it possible to determine molecular mechanisms for these entry steps. In the work described here, we have asked the following question: what fraction of the rotavirus particles that penetrate into the cell make new viral RNA? We find that of the cell-attached particles, between 20 and 50% ultimately penetrate, and of these, about 10% make RNA. RNA synthesis by even a single virus particle can initiate a productive infection.

AB Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of the many nonpolio enteroviruses that cause mild to severe respiratory illness. The nonstructural protein 3D(pol) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of EV-D68 which plays a critical role in the replication of the viral genome and represents a promising drug target. Here, we report the first three-dimensional crystal structure of the RdRP from EV-D68 in complex with the substrate GTP to 2.3-angstrom resolution. The RdRP structure is similar to structures of other viral RdRPs, where the three domains, termed the palm, fingers, and thumb, form a structure resembling a cupped right hand. Particularly, an N-terminal fragment (Gly1 to Phe30) bridges the fingers and the thumb domains, which accounts for the enhanced stability of the full-length enzyme over the truncation mutant, as assessed by our thermal shift assays and the dynamic light scattering studies. Additionally, the GTP molecule bound proximal to the active site interacts with both the palm and fingers domains to stabilize the core structure of 3Dpol. Interestingly, using limited proteolysis assays, we found that different nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) stabilize the polymerase structure by various degrees, with GTP and CTP being the most and least stabilizing nucleosides, respectively. Lastly, we derived a model of the core structure of 3Dpol stabilized by GTP, according to our proteolytic studies. The biochemical and biophysical characterizations conducted in this study help us to understand the stability of EV-D68-3Dpol, which may extend to other RdRPs as well.
   IMPORTANCE Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging viral pathogen, which caused sporadic infections around the world. In recent years, epidemiology studies have reported an increasing number of patients with respiratory diseases globally due to the EV-D68 infection. Moreover, the infection has been associated with acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction in children. However, there are no vaccines and antiviral treatments specifically targeting the virus to date. In this study, we solved the crystal structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of EV-D68 and carried out systematic biophysical and biochemical characterizations on the overall and local structural stability of the wild-type (WT) enzyme and several variants, which yields a clear view on the structure-activity relationship of the EV-D68 RNA polymerase.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is extraordinarily diverse and uses entry factors in a strain-specific manner. Virus particles associate with lipoproteins, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is critical for HCV assembly and infectivity. However, whether ApoE dependency is common to all HCV genotypes remains unknown. Therefore, we compared the roles of ApoE utilizing 10 virus strains from genotypes 1 through 7. ApoA and ApoC also support HCV assembly, so they may contribute to virus production in a strain-dependent fashion. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed abundant coexpression of ApoE, ApoB, ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, and ApoC3 in primary hepatocytes and in Huh-7.5 cells. Virus production was examined in Huh-7.5 cells with and without ApoE expression and in 293T cells where individual apolipoproteins (ApoE1, -E2, - E3, -A1, -A2, -C1, and -C3) were provided in trans. All strains were strictly ApoE dependent. However, ApoE involvement in virus production was strain and cell type specific, because some HCV strains poorly produced infectious virus in ApoE-expressing 293T cells and because ApoE knockout differentially affected virus production of HCV strains in Huh-7.5 cells. ApoE allelic isoforms (ApoE2, - E3, and -E4) complemented virus production of HCV strains to comparable degrees. All tested strains assembled infectious progeny with ApoE in preference to other exchangeable apolipoproteins (ApoA1, -A2, -C1, and -C3). The specific infectivity of HCV particles was similar for 293T- and Huh-7.5-derived particles for most strains; however, it differed by more than 100-fold in some viruses. Collectively, this study reveals strain-dependent and host cell-dependent use of ApoE during HCV assembly. These differences relate to the efficacy of virus production and also to the properties of released virus particles and therefore govern viral fitness at the level of assembly and cell entry.
   IMPORTANCE Chronic HCV infections are a major cause of liver disease. HCV is highly variable, and strain-specific determinants modulate the response to antiviral therapy, the natural course of infection, and cell entry factor usage. Here we explored whether host factor dependency of HCV in particle assembly is modulated by strain-dependent viral properties. We showed that all examined HCV strains, which represent all seven known genotypes, rely on ApoE expression for assembly of infectious progeny. However, the degree of ApoE dependence is modulated in a strainspecific and cell type-dependent manner. This indicates that HCV strains differ in their assembly properties and host factor usage during assembly of infectious progeny. Importantly, these differences relate not only to the efficiency of virus production and release but also to the infectiousness of virus particles. Thus, straindependent features of HCV modulate ApoE usage, with implications for virus fitness at the level of assembly and cell entry.

AB The replication cycle of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) leads to drastic reorganization of domains in the host cell nucleus. However, the mechanisms involved and how these domains contribute to infection are not well understood. Our recent studies defining the CMV-induced nuclear proteome identified several viral proteins of unknown functions, including a protein encoded by the UL31 gene. We set out to define the role of UL31 in CMV replication. UL31 is predicted to encode a 74-kDa protein, referred to as pUL31, containing a bipartite nuclear localization signal, an intrinsically disordered region overlapping arginine-rich motifs, and a C-terminal dUTPase-like structure. We observed that pUL31 is expressed with true late kinetics and is localized to nucleolin-containing nuclear domains. However, pUL31 is excluded from the viral nuclear replication center. Nucleolin is a marker of nucleoli, which are membrane-less regions involved in regulating ribosome biosynthesis and cellular stress responses. Other CMV proteins associate with nucleoli, and we demonstrate that pUL31 specifically interacts with the viral protein, pUL76. Coexpression of both proteins altered pUL31 localization and nucleolar organization. During infection, pUL31 colocalizes with nucleolin but not the transcriptional activator, UBF. In the absence of pUL31, CMV fails to reorganize nucleolin and UBF and exhibits a replication defect at a low multiplicity of infection. Finally, we observed that pUL31 is necessary and sufficient to reduce pre-rRNA levels, and this was dependent on the dUTPase-like motif in pUL31. Our studies demonstrate that CMV pUL31 functions in regulating nucleolar biology and contributes to the reorganization of nucleoli during infection.
   IMPORTANCE Nucleolar biology is important during CMV infection with the nucleolar protein, with nucleolin playing a role in maintaining the architecture of the viral nuclear replication center. However, the extent of CMV-mediated regulation of nucleolar biology is not well established. Proteins within nucleoli regulate ribosome biosynthesis and p53-dependent cellular stress responses that are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, and they are proposed targets for cancer therapies. This study establishes that CMV protein pUL31 is necessary and sufficient to regulate nucleolar biology involving the reorganization of nucleolar proteins. Understanding these processes will help define approaches to stimulate cellular intrinsic stress responses that are capable of inhibiting CMV infection.

AB Virus infection of humans and livestock can be devastating for individuals and populations, sometimes resulting in large economic and societal impact. Prevention of virus disease by vaccination or antiviral agents is difficult to achieve. A notable exception was the eradication of human smallpox by vaccination over 30 years ago. Today, humans and animals remain susceptible to poxvirus infections, including zoonotic poxvirus transmission. Here we identified a small molecule, bisbenzimide (bisbenzimidazole), and its derivatives as potent agents against prototypic poxvirus infection in cell culture. We show that bisbenzimide derivatives, which preferentially bind the minor groove of double-stranded DNA, inhibit vaccinia virus infection by blocking viral DNA replication and abrogating postreplicative intermediate and late gene transcription. The bisbenzimide derivatives are potent against vaccinia virus and other poxviruses but ineffective against a range of other DNA and RNA viruses. The bisbenzimide derivatives are the first inhibitors of their class, which appear to directly target the viral genome without affecting cell viability.
   IMPORTANCE Smallpox was one of the most devastating diseases in human history until it was eradicated by a worldwide vaccination campaign. Due to discontinuation of routine vaccination more than 30 years ago, the majority of today's human population remains susceptible to infection with poxviruses. Here we present a family of bisbenzimide (bisbenzimidazole) derivatives, known as Hoechst nuclear stains, with high potency against poxvirus infection. Results from a variety of assays used to dissect the poxvirus life cycle demonstrate that bisbenzimides inhibit viral gene expression and genome replication. These findings can lead to the development of novel antiviral drugs that target viral genomes and block viral replication.

TI Sec24C-Dependent Transport of Claudin-1 Regulates Hepatitis C Virus

AB Claudin-1 is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) coreceptor required for viral entry. Although extensive studies have focused on claudin-1 as an anti-HCV target, little is known about how the level of claudin-1 at the cell surface is regulated by host vesicular transport. Here, we identified an interaction between claudin-1 and Sec24C, a cargo-sorting component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicular transport system. By interacting with Sec24C through its C-terminal YV, claudin-1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is eventually targeted to the cell surface. Blocking COPII transport inhibits HCV entry by reducing the level of claudin-1 at the cell surface. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of COPII vesicular transport in HCV entry.
   IMPORTANCE Tight junction protein claudin-1 is one of the cellular receptors for hepatitis C virus, which infects 185 million people globally. Its cellular distribution plays important role in HCV entry; however, it is unclear how the localization of claudin-1 to the cell surface is controlled by host transport pathways. In this paper, we not only identified Sec24C as a key host factor for HCV entry but also uncovered a novel mechanism by which the COPII machinery transports claudin-1 to the cell surface. This mechanism might be extended to other claudins that contain a C-terminal YV or V motif.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes epidemics of encephalitis and viscerotropic disease worldwide. This virus has spread rapidly and has posed a significant public health threat since the outbreak in New York City in 1999. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response represents an important component of virus-host interactions and plays an essential role in regulating viral replication. Previous studies have suggested that multifunctional nonstructural proteins encoded by flaviviruses antagonize the host IFN response via various means in order to establish efficient viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of WNV antagonizes IFN-beta production, most likely through suppression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) activation. In a dual-luciferase reporter assay, WNV NS1 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-beta promoter after Sendai virus infection or poly(I.C) treatment. NS1 also suppressed the activation of the IFN-beta promoter when it was stimulated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/5D or its upstream molecules in the RLR signaling pathway. Furthermore, NS1 blocked the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation by various inducers. Mechanistically, WNV NS1 targets RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) by interacting with them and subsequently causing their degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, WNV NS1 inhibits the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby inhibiting the activation of downstream sensors in the RLR signaling pathway. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which WNV NS1 interferes with the host antiviral response.
   IMPORTANCE WNV Nile virus (WNV) has received increased attention since its introduction to the United States. However, the pathogenesis of this virus is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of WNV antagonizes the induction of interferon beta (IFN-beta) by interacting with and degrading retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), which are crucial viral sensors in the host innate immune system. Further experiments suggested that NS1-mediated inhibition of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway involves inhibition of RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination and that the proteasome plays a role in RIG-I degradation. This study provides new insights into the regulation of WNV NS1 in the RLR signaling pathway and reveals a novel mechanism by which WNV evades the host innate immune response. The novel findings may guide us to discover new therapeutic targets and develop effective vaccines for WNV infections.

AB Filovirus nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), and polymerase L are essential for viral replication and nucleocapsid formation. Here, we identify a 28-residue peptide (NP binding peptide [NPBP]) from Marburg virus (MARV) VP35 through sequence alignment with previously identified Ebola virus (EBOV) NPBP, which bound to the core region (residues 18 to 344) of the N-terminal portion of MARV NP with high affinity. The crystal structure of the MARV NP core/NPBP complex at a resolution of 2.6 angstrom revealed that NPBP binds to the C-terminal region of the NP core via electrostatic and nonpolar interactions. Further structural analysis revealed that the MARV and EBOV NP cores hold a conserved binding pocket for NPBP, and this pocket could serve as a promising target for the design of universal drugs against filovirus infection. In addition, cross-binding assays confirmed that the NP core of MARV or EBOV can bind the NPBP from the other virus, although with moderately reduced binding affinities that result from termini that are distinct between the MARV and EBOV NPBPs.
   IMPORTANCE Historically, Marburg virus (MARV) has caused severe disease with up to 90% lethality. Among the viral proteins produced by MARV, NP and VP35 are both multifunctional proteins that are essential for viral replication. In its relative, Ebola virus (EBOV), an N-terminal peptide from VP35 binds to the NP N-terminal region with high affinity. Whether this is a common mechanism among filoviruses is an unsolved question. Here, we present the crystal structure of a complex that consists of the core domain of MARV NP and the NPBP peptide from VP35. As we compared MARV NPBP with EBOV NPBP, several different features at the termini were identified. Although these differences reduce the affinity of the NP core for NPBPs across genera, a conserved pocket in the C-terminal region of the NP core makes cross-species binding possible. Our results expand our knowledge of filovirus NP-VP35 interactions and provide more details for therapeutic intervention.

AB In gene-for-gene host-virus interactions, virus evolution to infect and multiply in previously resistant host genotypes, i.e., resistance breaking, is a case of host range expansion, which is predicted to be associated with fitness penalties. Negative effects of resistance-breaking mutations on within-host virus multiplication have been documented for several plant viruses. However, understanding virus evolution requires analyses of potential trade-offs between different fitness components. Here we analyzed whether coat protein (CP) mutations in Pepper mild mottle virus that break L-gene resistance in pepper affect particle stability and, thus, survival in the environment. For this purpose, CP mutations determining the overcoming of L-3 and L-4 resistance alleles were introduced in biologically active cDNA clones. The kinetics of the in vitro disassembly of parental and mutant particles were compared under different conditions. Resistance-breaking mutations variously affected particle stability. Structural analyses identified the number and type of axial and side interactions of adjacent CP subunits in virions, which explained differences in particle stability and contribute to understanding of tobamovirus disassembly. Resistance-breaking mutations also affected virus multiplication and virulence in the susceptible host, as well as infectivity. The sense and magnitude of the effects of resistance-breaking mutations on particle stability, multiplication, virulence, or infectivity depended on the specific mutation rather than on the ability to overcome the different resistance alleles, and effects on different traits were not correlated. Thus, the results do not provide evidence of links or trade-offs between particle stability, i.e., survival, and other components of virus fitness or virulence.
   IMPORTANCE The effect of survival on virus evolution remains underexplored, despite the fact that life history trade-offs may constrain virus evolution. We approached this topic by analyzing whether breaking of L-gene resistance in pepper by Pepper mild mottle virus, determined by coat protein (CP) mutations, is associated with reduced particle stability and survival. Resistance-breaking mutations affected particle stability by altering the interactions between CP subunits. However, the sense and magnitude of these effects were unrelated to the capacity to overcome different resistance alleles. Thus, resistance breaking was not traded with survival. Resistance-breaking mutations also affected virus fitness within the infected host, virulence, and infectivity in a mutation-specific manner. Comparison of the effects of CP mutations on these various traits indicates that there are neither trade-offs nor positive links between survival and other life history traits. These results demonstrate that trade-offs between life history traits may not be a general constraint in virus evolution.

AB Many viral infections cause host shutoff, a state in which host protein synthesis is globally inhibited. Emerging evidence from vaccinia and influenza A virus infections indicates that subsets of cellular proteins are resistant to host shutoff and continue to be synthesized. Remarkably, the proteins of oxidative phosphorylation, the cellular-energy-generating machinery, are selectively synthesized in both cases. Identifying mechanisms that drive selective protein synthesis should facilitate understanding both viral replication and fundamental cell biology.

TI Functional Evolution of Influenza Virus NS1 Protein in Currently

AB In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in humans, causing a global pandemic. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from this human 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus was an effective interferon (IFN) antagonist but could not inhibit general host gene expression, unlike other NS1 proteins from seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Here we show that the NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses has evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) with respect to the original protein. Notably, these 6 residue changes restore the ability of pH1N1 NS1 to inhibit general host gene expression, mainly by their ability to restore binding to the cellular factor CPSF30. This is the first report describing the ability of the pH1N1 NS1 protein to naturally acquire mutations that restore this function. Importantly, a recombinant pH1N1 virus containing these 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) inhibited host IFN and proinflammatory responses to a greater extent than that with the parental virus (pH1N1/NS1-wt), yet virus titers were not significantly increased in cell cultures or in mouse lungs, and the disease was partially attenuated. The pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus grew similarly to pH1N1/NSs-wt in mouse lungs, but infection with pH1N1/NSs-6mut induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, likely due to a general inhibition of gene expression mediated by the mutated NS1 protein. This lower level of inflammation induced by the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus likely accounts for the attenuated disease phenotype and may represent a host-virus adaptation affecting influenza virus pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans. In addition, occasional pandemics are caused when IAVs circulating in other species emerge in the human population. In 2009, a swine-origin H1N1 IAV (pH1N1) was transmitted to humans, infecting people then and up to the present. It was previously shown that the NS1 protein from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus is not able to inhibit general gene expression. However, currently circulating pH1N1 viruses have evolved to encode 6 amino acid changes (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) that allow the NS1 protein of contemporary pH1N1 strains to inhibit host gene expression, which correlates with its ability to interact with CPSF30. Infection with a recombinant pH1N1 virus encoding these 6 amino acid changes (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) induced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in viral attenuation in vivo. This might represent an adaptation of pH1N1 virus to humans.

AB Understanding the interactions between rabies virus (RABV) and individual host cell proteins is critical for the development of targeted therapies. Here we report that interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit2), an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) with possible RNA-binding capacity, is an important restriction factor for rabies virus. When Ifit2 was depleted, RABV grew more quickly in mouse neuroblastoma cells in vitro. This effect was replicated in vivo, where Ifit2 knockout mice displayed a dramatically more severe disease phenotype than wildtype mice after intranasal inoculation of RABV. This increase in pathogenicity correlated to an increase in RABV mRNA and live viral load in the brain, as well as to an accelerated spread to brain regions normally affected by this RABV model. These results suggest that Ifit2 exerts its antiviral effect mainly at the level of viral replication, as opposed to functioning as a mechanism that restricts viral entry/egress or transports RABV particles through axons.
   IMPORTANCE Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease with a nearly 100% case fatality rate. Although there are effective vaccines for rabies, this disease still takes the lives of about 50,000 people each year. Victims tend to be children living in regions without comprehensive medical infrastructure who present to health care workers too late for postexposure prophylaxis. The protein discussed in our report, Ifit2, is found to be an important restriction factor for rabies virus, acting directly or indirectly against viral replication. A more nuanced understanding of this interaction may reveal a step of a pathway or site at which the system could be exploited for the development of a targeted therapy.

AB Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are endemic in swine and represent a public health risk. However, there is limited information on the genetic diversity of swine IAVs within farrow-to-wean farms, which is where most pigs are born. In this longitudinal study, we sampled 5 farrow-to-wean farms for a year and collected 4,190 individual nasal swabs from three distinct pig subpopulations. Of these, 207 (4.9%) samples tested PCR positive for IAV, and 124 IAVs were isolated. We sequenced the complete genomes of 123 IAV isolates and found 31 H1N1, 26 H1N2, 63 H3N2, and 3 mixed IAVs. Based on the IAV hemagglutinin, seven different influenza A viral groups (VGs) were identified. Most of the remaining IAV gene segments allowed us to differentiate the same VGs, although an additional viral group was identified for gene segment 3 (PA). Moreover, the codetection of more than one IAV VG was documented at different levels (farm, subpopulation, and individual pigs), highlighting the environment for potential IAV reassortment. Additionally, 3 out of 5 farms contained IAV isolates (n = 5) with gene segments from more than one VG, and 79% of all the IAVs sequenced contained a signature mutation (S31N) in the matrix gene that has been associated with resistance to the antiviral amantadine. Within farms, some IAVs were detected only once, while others were detected for 283 days. Our results illustrate the maintenance and subsidence of different IAVs within swine farrow-to-wean farms over time, demonstrating that pig subpopulation dynamics are important to better understand the diversity and epidemiology of swine IAVs.
   IMPORTANCE On a global scale, swine are one of the main reservoir species for influenza A viruses (IAVs) and play a key role in the transmission of IAVs between species. Additionally, the 2009 IAV pandemics highlighted the role of pigs in the emergence of IAVs with pandemic potential. However, limited information is available regarding the diversity and distribution of swine IAVs on farrow-to-wean farms, where novel IAVs can emerge. In this study, we studied 5 swine farrow-to-wean farms for a year and characterized the genetic diversity of IAVs among three different pig subpopulations commonly housed on this type of farm. Using next-generation-sequencing technologies, we demonstrated the complex distribution and diversity of IAVs among the pig subpopulations studied. Our results demonstrated the dynamic evolution of IAVs within farrow-to-wean farms, which is crucial to improve health interventions to reduce the risk of transmission between pigs and from pigs to people.

AB The peptide drug enfuvirtide (T20) is the only viral fusion inhibitor used in combination therapy for HIV-1 infection, but it has relatively low antiviral activity and easily induces drug resistance. Emerging studies demonstrate that lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors, such as LP-11 and LP-19, which mainly target the gp41 pocket site, have greatly improved antiviral potency and in vivo stability. In this study, we focused on developing a T20-based lipopeptide inhibitor that lacks pocket-binding sequence and targets a different site. First, the C-terminal tryptophan-rich motif (TRM) of T20 was verified to be essential for its target binding and inhibition; then, a novel lipopeptide, termed LP-40, was created by replacing the TRM with a fatty acid group. LP-40 showed markedly enhanced binding affinity for the target site and dramatically increased inhibitory activity on HIV-1 membrane fusion, entry, and infection. Unlike LP-11 and LP-19, which required a flexible linker between the peptide sequence and the lipid moiety, addition of a linker to LP-40 sharply reduced its potency, implying different binding modes with the extended N-terminal helices of gp41. Also, interestingly, LP-40 showed more potent activity than LP-11 in inhibiting HIV-1 Envmediated cell-cell fusion while it was less active than LP-11 in inhibiting pseudovirus entry, and the two inhibitors displayed synergistic antiviral effects. The crystal structure of LP-40 in complex with a target peptide revealed their key binding residues and motifs. Combined, our studies have not only provided a potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, but also revealed new insights into the mechanisms of viral inhibition.
   IMPORTANCE T20 is the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for treatment of viral infection; however, T20 requires high doses and has a low genetic barrier for resistance, and its inhibitory mechanism and structural basis remain unclear. Here, we report the design of LP-40, a T20-based lipopeptide inhibitor that has greatly improved anti-HIV activity and is a more potent inhibitor of cell-cell fusion than of cell-free virus infection. The binding modes of two classes of membrane-anchoring lipopeptides (LP-40 and LP-11) verify the current fusion model in which an extended prehairpin structure bridges the viral and cellular membranes, and their complementary effects suggest a vital strategy for combination therapy of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanism of action of T20 and its derivatives benefits from the crystal structure of LP-40.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a phosphoprotein that plays key, yet poorly defined, roles in both virus genome replication and virion assembly/ release. It has been proposed that differential phosphorylation could act as a switch to regulate the various functions of NS5A; however, the mechanistic details of the role of this posttranslational modification in the virus life cycle remain obscure. We previously reported (D. Ross-Thriepland, J. Mankouri, and M. Harris, J Virol 89: 3123-3135, 2015, doi: 10.1128/JVI.02995-14) a role for phosphorylation at serine 225 (S225) of NS5A in the regulation of JFH-1 (genotype 2a) genome replication. A phosphoablatant (S225A) mutation resulted in a 10-fold reduction in replication and a perinuclear restricted distribution of NS5A, whereas the corresponding phosphomimetic mutation (S225D) had no phenotype. To determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenotype we conducted a label-free proteomics approach to identify cellular NS5A interaction partners. This analysis revealed that the S225A mutation disrupted the interactions of NS5A with a number of cellular proteins, in particular the nucleosome assembly protein 1-like protein 1 (NAP1L1), bridging integrator 1 (Bin1, also known as amphiphysin II), and vesicleassociated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A). These interactions were validated by immunoprecipitation/ Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assay. Importantly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of NAP1L1, Bin1 or VAP-A impaired viral genome replication and recapitulated the perinuclear redistribution of NS5A seen in the S225A mutant. These results demonstrate that S225 phosphorylation regulates the interactions of NS5A with a defined subset of cellular proteins. Furthermore, these interactions regulate both HCV genome replication and the subcellular localization of replication complexes.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus is an important human pathogen. The viral nonstructural 5A protein (NS5A) is the target for new antiviral drugs. NS5A has multiple functions during the virus life cycle, but the biochemical details of these roles remain obscure. NS5A is known to be phosphorylated by cellular protein kinases, and in this study, we set out to determine whether this modification is required for the binding of NS5A to other cellular proteins. We identified 3 such proteins and show that they interacted only with NS5A that was phosphorylated on a specific residue. Furthermore, these proteins were required for efficient virus replication and the ability of NS5A to spread throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. Our results help to define the function of NS5A and may contribute to an understanding of the mode of action of the highly potent antiviral drugs that are targeted to NS5A.

AB Despite the high incidence of severe defects in the central nervous system caused by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) congenital infection, the mechanism of HCMV neuropathogenesis and the roles of individual viral genes have not yet been fully determined. In this study, we show that the immediate-early 2 (IE2) protein may play a key role in HCMV-caused neurodevelopmental disorders. IE2-transduced neural progenitor cells gave rise to neurospheres with a lower frequency and produced smaller neurospheres than control cells in vitro, indicating reduction of self-renewal and expansion of neural progenitors by IE2. At 2 days after in utero electroporation into the ventricle of the developing brain, a dramatically lower percentage of IE2expressing cells was detected in the ventricular zone (VZ) and cortical plate (CP) compared to control cells, suggesting that IE2 concurrently dysregulates neural stem cell maintenance in the VZ and neuronal migration to the CP. In addition, most IE2(+) cells in the lower intermediate zone either showed multipolar morphology with short neurites or possessed nonradially oriented processes, whereas control cells had long, radially oriented monopolar or bipolar neurites. IE2(+) callosal axons also failed to cross the midline to form the corpus callosum. Furthermore, we provide molecular evidence that the cell cycle arrest and DNA binding activities of IE2 appear to be responsible for the increased neural stem cell exit from the VZ and cortical migrational defects, respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IE2 disrupts the orderly process of brain development in a stepwise manner to further our understanding of neurodevelopmental HCMV pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE HCMV brain pathogenesis has been studied in limited experimental settings, such as in vitro HCMV infection of neural progenitor cells or in vivo murine CMV infection of the mouse brain. Here, we show that IE2 is a pivotal factor that contributes to HCMV-induced abnormalities in the context of the embryonic brain using an in utero gene transfer tool. Surprisingly, IE2, but not HCMV IE1 or murine CMV ie3, interferes pleiotropically with key neurodevelopmental processes, including neural stem cell regulation, proper positioning of migrating neurons, and the callosal axon projections important for communication between the hemispheres. Our data suggest that the wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from mental retardation to microcephaly, caused by congenital HCMV infection can be sufficiently explained in terms of IE2 action alone.

AB Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16; Picornaviridae) is an enterovirus (EV) type associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. To investigate the spatial spread of CV-A16, we used viral sequence data sampled during a prospective sentinel surveillance of HFMD in France (2010 to 2014) and phylogenetic reconstruction. A data set of 168 VP1 sequences was assembled with 416 publicly available sequences of various geographic origins. The CV-A16 sequences reported were assigned to two clades, genogroup B and a previously uncharacterized clade D. The time origins of clades B and D were assessed in 1978 (1973 to 1981) and 2004 (2001 to 2007), respectively. The shape of the global CV-A16 phylogeny indicated worldwide cocirculation of genetically distinct virus lineages over time and across geographic regions. Phylogenetic tree topologies and Bayes factor analysis indicated virus migration. Virus transportation events in clade B within Europe and Asia and between countries of the two geographic regions were assessed. The sustained transmission of clade D viruses over 4 years was analyzed at the township level in France and traced back to Peru in South America. Comparative genomics provided evidence of recombination between CV-A16 clades B and D and suggested an intertype recombinant origin for clade D. Time-resolved phylogenies and HFMD surveillance data indicated that CV-A16 persistence is sustained by continuing virus migration at different geographic scales, from community transmission to virus transportation between distant countries. The results showed a significant impact of virus movements on the epidemiological dynamics of HFMD that could have implications for disease prevention.
   IMPORTANCE Coxsackievirus A16 is one of the most prevalent enterovirus types in hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks reported in Southeast Asia. This study is based on epidemiological and viral data on HFMD caused by CV-A16 in a European country. The phylogeographic data complemented the syndromic surveillance with virus migration patterns between geographic regions in France. The results show how viral evolutionary dynamics and global virus spread interact to shape the worldwide pattern of an EV disease. CV-A16 transmission is driven by movements of infected individuals at different geographic levels: within a country (local dynamics), between neighboring countries (regional dynamics), and between distant countries (transcontinental dynamics). The results are consistent with our earlier data on EV-A71 and confirm the epidemiological interconnection of Asia and Europe with regard to EV infections.

AB Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses expressing their replicase as a polyprotein, P1234, which is cleaved to four final products, nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins.
   IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.

AB Mechanisms of neuronal infection by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been challenging to study due to the relatively strict human tropism of the virus and the paucity of tractable experimental models. Cellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to play a role in VZV infection of nonneuronal cells, with distinct consequences for infectivity in different cell types. Here, we utilize several human neuronal culture systems to investigate the role of one such MAPK, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), in VZV lytic infection and reactivation. We find that the JNK pathway is specifically activated following infection of human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons and that this activation of JNK is essential for efficient viral protein expression and replication. Inhibition of the JNK pathway blocked viral replication in a manner distinct from that of acyclovir, and an acyclovir-resistant VZV isolate was as sensitive to the effects of JNK inhibition as an acyclovir-sensitive VZV isolate in neurons. Moreover, in a microfluidic-based human neuronal model of viral latency and reactivation, we found that inhibition of the JNK pathway resulted in a marked reduction in reactivation of VZV. Finally, we utilized a novel technique to efficiently generate cells expressing markers of human sensory neurons from neural crest cells and established a critical role for the JNK pathway in infection of these cells. In summary, the JNK pathway plays an important role in lytic infection and reactivation of VZV in physiologically relevant cell types and may provide an alternative target for antiviral therapy.
   IMPORTANCE Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) has infected over 90% of people worldwide. While primary infection leads to the typically self-limiting condition of chickenpox, the virus can remain dormant in the nervous system and may reactivate later in life, leading to shingles or inflammatory diseases of the nervous system and eye with potentially severe consequences. Here, we take advantage of newer stem cell-based technologies to study the mechanisms by which VZV infects human neurons. We find that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated by VZV infection and that blockade of this pathway limits lytic replication (as occurs during primary infection). In addition, JNK inhibition limits viral reactivation, exhibiting parallels with herpes simplex virus reactivation. The identification of the role of the JNK pathway in VZV infection of neurons reveals potential avenues for the development of alternate antiviral drugs.

AB The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa demonstrates the potential for a significant public health burden caused by filoviral infections. No vaccine or antiviral is currently FDA approved. To expand the vaccine options potentially available, we assessed protection conferred by an EBOV vaccine composed of vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirions that lack native G glycoprotein (VSV Delta G) and bear EBOV glycoprotein (GP). These pseudovirions mediate a single round of infection. Both single-dose and prime/boost vaccination regimens protected mice against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted Ebola virus (ma-EBOV) in a dose-dependent manner. The prime/boost regimen provided significantly better protection than a single dose. As N-linked glycans are thought to shield conserved regions of the EBOV GP receptor-binding domain (RBD), thereby blocking epitopes within the RBD, we also tested whether VSV Delta G bearing EBOV GPs that lack GP1 N-linked glycans provided effective immunity against challenge with ma-EBOV or a more distantly related virus, Sudan virus. Using a prime/boost strategy, high doses of GP/VSV Delta G partially or fully denuded of N-linked glycans on GP1 protected mice against ma-EBOV challenge, but these mutants were no more effective than wild-type (WT) GP/VSV Delta G and did not provide cross protection against Sudan virus. As reported for other EBOV vaccine platforms, the protection conferred correlated with the quantity of EBOV GP-specific Ig produced but not with the production of neutralizing antibodies. Our results show that EBOV GP/VSV Delta G pseudovirions serve as a successful vaccination platform in a rodent model of Ebola virus disease and that GP1 N-glycan loss does not influence immunogenicity or vaccination success.
   IMPORTANCE The West African Ebola virus epidemic was the largest to date, with more than 28,000 people infected. No FDA-approved vaccines are yet available, but in a trial vaccination strategy in West Africa, recombinant, infectious VSV encoding the Ebola virus glycoprotein effectively prevented virus-associated disease. VSV Delta G pseudovirion vaccines may prove as efficacious and have better safety, but they have not been tested to date. Thus, we tested the efficacy of VSV Delta G pseudovirions bearing Ebola virus glycoprotein as a vaccine platform. We found that wild-type Ebola virus glycoprotein, in the context of this platform, provides robust protection of EBOV-challenged mice. Further, we found that removal of the heavy glycan shield surrounding conserved regions of the glycoprotein does not enhance vaccine efficacy.

AB Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which belongs to the Gammaherpesviridae, typically displays two different phases in its life cycle, the latent phase and the lytic phase. Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), the primary viral product during latency, has been reported to bind to a series of cellular gene promoters to modulate gene transcription. To systemically elucidate the cellular genes regulated by LANA, we identified genome-wide LANA binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIP-seq). We stratified ChIP-seq data and found that LANA might be involved in the macromolecule catabolic process. Specifically, we found and verified that LANA could directly bind to the promoter of the SUMO/ sentrin-specific peptidase 6 (SENP6) gene in vivo and in vitro. LANA could repress SENP6 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in a reporter gene assay. LANA expression was sufficient to inhibit endogenous SENP6 expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Moreover, SENP6 overexpression in KSHV-infected cells reduced LANA at the protein level. Mechanistically, we found that SENP6 could interact with LANA and reduce the formation of sumoylated LANA, which relies on the desumoylation ability of SENP6. During de novo infection, SENP6 overexpression would decrease the abundance of LANA and enhance viral gene expression, which would hamper the establishment of latency. Taken together, these data suggest that KSHV-encoded LANA could inhibit SENP6 expression to regulate the abundance of itself, which may play an important role in controlling the establishment of latency.
   IMPORTANCE LANA, as a key latent protein produced by KSHV, is responsible for episome persistence and regulates viral reactivation. In the present study, our results demonstrated that LANA could bind to the promoter region of the SENP6 gene and inhibit SENP6 expression while the regulated SENP6 could in turn modulate the abundance of LANA through desumoylation. This delicate regulation may provide important insights to explain the abundance of LANA during KSHV latency.

AB Productive viral infection often depends on the manipulation of the cytoskeleton. Herpesviruses, including rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) and its close homolog, the oncogenic human gammaherpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/ human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV8), exploit microtubule (MT)-based retrograde transport to deliver their genomes to the nucleus. Subsequently, during the lytic phase of the life cycle, the maturing viral particles undergo orchestrated translocation to specialized regions within the cytoplasm, leading to tegumentation, secondary envelopment, and then egress. As a result, we hypothesized that RRV might induce changes in the cytoskeleton at both early and late stages of infection. Using confocal imaging, we found that RRV infection led to the thickening and acetylation of MTs emanating from the MT-organizing center (MTOC) shortly after viral entry and more pronounced and diffuse MT reorganization during peak stages of lytic gene expression and virion production. We subsequently identified open reading frame 52 (ORF52), a multifunctional and abundant tegument protein, as being the only virally encoded component responsible for these cytoskeletal changes. Mutational and modeling analyses indicated that an evolutionarily conserved, truncated leucine zipper motif near the N terminus as well as a strictly conserved arginine residue toward the C terminus of ORF52 play critical roles in its ability to rearrange the architecture of the MT cytoskeleton. Taken together, our findings combined with data from previous studies describing diverse roles for ORF52 suggest that it likely binds to different cellular components, thereby allowing context-dependent modulation of function.
   IMPORTANCE A thorough understanding of the processes governing viral infection includes knowledge of how viruses manipulate their intracellular milieu, including the cytoskeleton. Altering the dynamics of actin or MT polymerization, for example, is a common strategy employed by viruses to ensure efficient entry, maturation, and egress as well as the avoidance of antiviral defenses through the sequestration of key cellular factors. We found that infection with RRV, a homolog of the human pathogen KSHV, led to perinuclear wrapping by acetylated MT bundles and identified ORF52 as the viral protein underlying these changes. Remarkably, incoming virions were able to supply sufficient ORF52 to induce MT thickening and acetylation near the MTOC, potentially aiding in the delivery viral genomes to the nucleus. Although the function of MT alterations during late stages of infection requires further study, ORF52 shares functional and structural similarities with alphaherpesvirus VP22, underscoring the evolutionary importance of MT cytoskeletal manipulations for this virus family.

AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA functions as the only viral template capable of coding for all the viral RNA species and is thus essential to initiate and sustain viral replication. CCC DNA is converted, in a multistep and ill-understood process, from a relaxed circular (RC) DNA, in which neither of the two DNA strands is covalently closed. To detect putative intermediates during RC DNA to CCC DNA conversion, two 3' exonucleases, exonuclease I (Exo I) and Exo III, were used in combination to degrade all DNA strands with a free 3' end, which would nevertheless preserve closed circular DNA in either single-stranded (SS) or double-stranded (DS) form. Indeed, an RC DNA species with a covalently closed minus strand but an open plus strand (closed minus-strand RC DNA [cM-RC DNA]) was detected by this approach. Further analyses indicated that at least some of the plus strands in such a putative intermediate likely still retained the RNA primer that is attached to the 5' end of the plus strand in RC DNA, suggesting that minus-strand closing can occur before plus-strand processing. Furthermore, the same nuclease treatment proved to be useful for sensitive and specific detection of CCC DNA by removing all DNA species other than closed circular DNA. Application of these and similar approaches may allow the identification of additional intermediates during CCC DNA formation and facilitate specific and sensitive detection of CCC DNA, which should help elucidate the pathways of CCC DNA formation and the factors involved.
   IMPORTANCE The hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, by serving as the viral transcriptional template, is the molecular basis of viral persistence. CCC DNA is converted, in a multistep and ill-understood process, from relaxed circular (RC) DNA. Little is currently understood about the pathways or factors involved in CCC DNA formation. We have now detected a likely intermediate during the conversion of RC DNA to CCC DNA, thus providing important clues to the pathways of CCC DNA formation. Furthermore, the same experimental approach that led to the detection of the intermediate could also facilitate specific and sensitive detection of CCC DNA, which has remained challenging. This and similar approaches will help identify additional intermediates during CCC DNA formation and elucidate the pathways and factors involved.

AB Pathogen recognition receptors are vital components of the immune system. Engagement of these receptors is important not only for instigation of innate immune responses to invading pathogens but also for initiating the adaptive immune response. Members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family of pathogen recognition receptors have important roles in orchestrating this response. The NLR family member NLRC5 regulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression during various types of infections, but its role in immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is not well studied. Here we show that Nlrc5(-/-) mice exhibit an altered CD8(+) T cell response during IAV infection compared to that of wild-type (WT) mice. Nlrc5(-/-) mice have decreased MHC-I expression on hematopoietic cells and fewer CD8(+) T cells prior to infection. NLRC5 deficiency does not affect the generation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells following IAV infection; however, a change in epitope dominance is observed in Nlrc5(-/-) mice. Moreover, IAV-specific CD8(+) T cells from Nlrc5(-/-) mice have impaired effector functions. This change in the adaptive immune response is associated with impaired viral clearance in Nlrc5(-/-) mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate an important role for NLRC5 in regulation of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance during IAV infection.
   IMPORTANCE The NOD-like receptor family member NLRC5 is known to regulate expression of MHC-I as well as other genes required for antigen processing. In addition, NLRC5 also regulates various immune signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of NLRC5 during influenza virus infection and found a major role for NLRC5 in restricting virus replication and promoting viral clearance. The observed increases in viral titers in NLRC5-deficient mice correlated with impaired effector CD8(+) T cell responses. Although NLRC5-deficient mice were defective at clearing the virus, they did not show an increase in morbidity or mortality following influenza virus infection because of other compensatory immune mechanisms. Therefore, our study highlights how NLRC5 regulates multiple immune effector mechanisms to promote the host defense during influenza virus infection.

AB Recent evidence indicates that inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) binding to the viral RNA genome by allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs) or through mutations within IN yields aberrant particles in which the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are eccentrically localized outside the capsid lattice. These particles are noninfectious and are blocked at an early reverse transcription stage in target cells. However, the basis of this reverse transcription defect is unknown. Here, we show that the viral RNA genome and IN from ALLINI-treated virions are prematurely degraded in target cells, whereas reverse transcriptase remains active and stably associated with the capsid lattice. The aberrantly shaped cores in ALLINI-treated particles can efficiently saturate and be degraded by a restricting TRIM5 protein, indicating that they are still composed of capsid proteins arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Notably, the fates of viral core components follow a similar pattern in cells infected with eccentric particles generated by mutations within IN that inhibit its binding to the viral RNA genome. We propose that IN-RNA interactions allow packaging of both the viral RNA genome and IN within the protective capsid lattice to ensure subsequent reverse transcription and productive infection in target cells. Conversely, disruption of these interactions by ALLINIs or mutations in IN leads to premature degradation of both the viral RNA genome and IN, as well as the spatial separation of reverse transcriptase from the viral genome during early steps of infection.
   IMPORTANCE Recent evidence indicates that HIV-1 integrase (IN) plays a key role during particle maturation by binding to the viral RNA genome. Inhibition of IN-RNA interactions yields aberrant particles with the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) eccentrically localized outside the conical capsid lattice. Although these particles contain all of the components necessary for reverse transcription, they are blocked at an early reverse transcription stage in target cells. To explain the basis of this defect, we tracked the fates of multiple viral components in infected cells. Here, we show that the viral RNA genome and IN in eccentric particles are prematurely degraded, whereas reverse transcriptase remains active and stably associated within the capsid lattice. We propose that IN-RNA interactions ensure the packaging of both vRNPs and IN within the protective capsid cores to facilitate subsequent reverse transcription and productive infection in target cells.

AB Follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells are a subset of CD4(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid follicles. TFR cells were previously included in the follicular helper T (TFH) cell subset, which consists of cells that are highly permissive to HIV-1. The permissivity of TFR cells to HIV-1 is unknown. We find that TFR cells are more permissive than TFH cells to R5-tropic HIV-1 ex vivo. TFR cells expressed more CCR5 and CD4 and supported higher frequencies of viral fusion. Differences in Ki67 expression correlated with HIV-1 replication. Inhibiting cellular proliferation reduced Ki67 expression and HIV-1 replication. Lymph node cells from untreated HIV-infected individuals revealed that TFR cells harbored the highest concentrations of HIV-1 RNA and highest levels of Ki67 expression. These data demonstrate that TFR cells are highly permissive to R5-tropic HIV-1 both ex vivo and in vivo. This is likely related to elevated CCR5 levels combined with a heightened proliferative state and suggests that TFR cells contribute to persistent R5-tropic HIV-1 replication in vivo.
   IMPORTANCE In chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection, viral replication is concentrated in secondary lymphoid follicles. Within secondary lymphoid follicles, follicular helper T (TFH) cells have previously been shown to be highly permissive to HIV-1. Recently, another subset of T cells in secondary lymphoid follicles was described, follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells. These cells share some phenotypic characteristics with TFH cells, and studies that showed that TFH cells are highly permissive to HIV-1 included TFR cells in their definition of TFH cells. The permissivity of TFR cells to HIV-1 has not previously been described. Here, we show that TFR cells are highly permissive to HIV-1 both ex vivo and in vivo. The expression of Ki67, a marker of proliferative capacity, is predictive of expression of viral proteins, and downregulating Ki67 leads to concurrent decreases in expression of viral proteins. Our study provides new insight into HIV-1 replication and a potential new cell type to target for future treatment.

AB In the large majority of cases, HIV infection is established by a single variant, and understanding the characteristics of successfully transmitted variants is relevant to prevention strategies. Few studies have investigated the viral determinants of mother-to-child transmission. To determine the impact of Gag-proteasedriven viral replication capacity on mother-to-child transmission, the replication capacities of 148 recombinant viruses encoding plasma-derived Gag-protease from 53 nontransmitter mothers, 48 transmitter mothers, and 47 infected infants were assayed in an HIV-1-inducible green fluorescent protein reporter cell line. All study participants were infected with HIV-1 subtype C. There was no significant difference in replication capacities between the nontransmitter (n = 53) and transmitter (n = 44) mothers (P = 0.48). Infant-derived Gag-protease NL4-3 recombinant viruses (n = 41) were found to have a significantly lower Gag-protease-driven replication capacity than that of viruses derived from the mothers (P = 0.0001 by a paired t test). High percent similarities to consensus subtype C Gag, p17, p24, and protease sequences were also found in the infants (n = 28) in comparison to their mothers (P = 0.07, P = 0.002, P = 0.03, and P = 0.02, respectively, as determined by a paired t test). These data suggest that of the viral quasispecies found in mothers, the HIV mother-to-child transmission bottleneck favors the transmission of consensus-like viruses with lower viral replication capacities.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding the characteristics of successfully transmitted HIV variants has important implications for preventative interventions. Little is known about the viral determinants of HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). We addressed the role of viral replication capacity driven by Gag, a major structural protein that is a significant determinant of overall viral replicative ability and an important target of the host immune response, in the MTCT bottleneck. This study advances our understanding of the genetic bottleneck in MTCT by revealing that viruses transmitted to infants have a lower replicative ability as well as a higher similarity to the population consensus (in this case HIV subtype C) than those of their mothers. Furthermore, the observation that "consensus-like" virus sequences correspond to lower in vitro replication abilities yet appear to be preferentially transmitted suggests that viral characteristics favoring transmission are decoupled from those that enhance replicative capacity.

AB Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, representing a serious public health concern. It has been described that one mechanism used by some IAV strains to escape the host innate immune responses and modulate virus pathogenicity involves the ability of the PA-X and NS1 proteins to inhibit the host protein synthesis in infected cells. It was reported that for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAV (pH1N1) only the PA-X protein had this inhibiting capability, while the NS1 protein did not. In this work, we have evaluated, for the first time, the combined effect of PA-X- and NS1-mediated inhibition of general gene expression on virus pathogenesis, using a temperature-sensitive, live-attenuated 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAV (pH1N1 LAIV). We found that viruses containing PA-X and NS1 proteins that simultaneously have (PA(WT)(+)/NS1(MUT)(+)) or do not have (PA(MUT)(-)/NS1(WT)(-)) the ability to block host gene expression showed reduced pathogenicity in vivo. However, a virus where the ability to inhibit host protein expression was switched between PA-X and NS1 (PA(WT)(+)/NS1(MUT)(+)) presented pathogenicity similar to that of a virus containing both wild-type proteins (PA(MUT)(-)/NS1(WT)(-)). Our findings suggest that inhibition of host protein expression is subject to a strict balance, which can determine the successful progression of IAV infection. Importantly, knowledge obtained from our studies could be used for the development of new and more effective vaccine approaches against IAV.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are one of the most common causes of respiratory infections in humans, resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Furthermore, IAVs can cause unpredictable pandemics of great consequence when viruses not previously circulating in humans are introduced into humans. The defense machinery provided by the host innate immune system limits IAV replication; however, to counteract host antiviral activities, IAVs have developed different inhibition mechanisms, including prevention of host gene expression mediated by the viral PA-X and NS1 proteins. Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that optimal control of host protein synthesis by IAV PA-X and/or NS1 proteins is required for efficient IAV replication in the host. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of genetically controlling the ability of IAV PA-X and NS1 proteins to inhibit host immune responses, providing an approach to develop more effective vaccines to combat disease caused by this important respiratory pathogen.

AB Reassortment of gene segments between coinfecting influenza A viruses (IAVs) facilitates viral diversification and has a significant epidemiological impact on seasonal and pandemic influenza. Since 1977, human IAVs of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have cocirculated with relatively few documented cases of reassortment. We evaluated the potential for viruses of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) and seasonal H3N2 lineages to reassort under experimental conditions. Results of heterologous coinfections with pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses were compared to those obtained following coinfection with homologous, genetically tagged, pH1N1 viruses as a control. High genotype diversity was observed among progeny of both coinfections; however, diversity was more limited following heterologous coinfection. Pairwise analysis of genotype patterns revealed that homologous reassortment was random while heterologous reassortment was characterized by specific biases. pH1N1/ H3N2 reassortant genotypes produced under single-cycle coinfection conditions showed a strong preference for homologous PB2-PA combinations and general preferences for the H3N2 NA, pH1N1 M, and H3N2 PB2 except when paired with the pH1N1 PA or NP. Multicycle coinfection results corroborated these findings and revealed an additional preference for the H3N2 HA. Segment compatibility was further investigated by measuring chimeric polymerase activity and growth of selected reassortants in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells. In guinea pigs inoculated with a mixture of viruses, parental H3N2 viruses dominated but reassortants also infected and transmitted to cage mates. Taken together, our results indicate that strong intrinsic barriers to reassortment between seasonal H3N2 and pH1N1 viruses are few but that the reassortants formed are attenuated relative to parental strains.
   IMPORTANCE The genome of IAV is relatively simple, comprising eight RNA segments, each of which typically encodes one or two proteins. Each viral protein carries out multiple functions in coordination with other viral components and the machinery of the cell. When two IAVs coinfect a cell, they can exchange genes through reassortment. The resultant progeny viruses often suffer fitness defects due to suboptimal interactions among divergent viral components. The genetic diversity generated through reassortment can facilitate the emergence of novel outbreak strains. Thus, it is important to understand the efficiency of reassortment and the factors that limit its potential. The research described here offers new tools for studying reassortment between two strains of interest and applies those tools to viruses of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 lineages, which currently cocirculate in humans and therefore have the potential to give rise to novel epidemic strains.

Adeno-associated virus receptor (AAVR) (also named KIAA0319L) is an essential cellular receptor required for the transduction of vectors derived from multiple AAV serotypes, including the evolutionarily distant serotypes AAV2 and AAV5. Here, we further biochemically characterize the AAV-AAVR interaction and define the domains within the ectodomain of AAVR that facilitate this interaction. By using a virus overlay assay, it was previously shown that the major AAV2 binding protein in membrane preparations of human cells corresponds to a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. By establishing a purification procedure, performing further protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and utilizing mass spectrometry, we now show that this glycoprotein is identical to AAVR. While we find that AAVR is an N-linked glycosylated protein, this glycosylation is not a strict requirement for AAV2 binding or functional transduction. Using a combination of genetic complementation with deletion constructs and virus overlay assays with individual domains, we find that AAV2 functionally interacts predominantly with the second Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) repeat domain (PKD2) present in the ectodomain of AAVR. In contrast, AAV5 interacts primarily through the first, most membrane-distal, PKD domain (PKD1) of AAVR to promote transduction. Furthermore, other AAV serotypes, including AAV1 and -8, require a combination of PKD1 and PKD2 for optimal transduction. These results suggest that despite their shared dependence on AAVR as a critical entry receptor, different AAV serotypes have evolved distinctive interactions with the same receptor.
   IMPORTANCE Over the past decade, AAV vectors have emerged as leading gene delivery tools for therapeutic applications and biomedical research. However, fundamental aspects of the AAV life cycle, including how AAV interacts with host cellular factors to facilitate infection, are only partly understood. In particular, AAV receptors contribute significantly to AAV vector transduction efficiency and tropism. The recently identified AAV receptor (AAVR) is a key host receptor for multiple serotypes, including the most studied serotype, AAV2. AAVR binds directly to AAV2 particles and is rate limiting for viral transduction. Defining the AAV-AAVR interface in more detail is important to understand how AAV engages with its cellular receptor and how the receptor facilitates the entry process. Here, we further define AAV-AAVR interactions, genetically and biochemically, and show that different AAV serotypes have discrete interactions with the Ig-like PKD domains of AAVR. These findings reveal an unexpected divergence of AAVR engagement within these parvoviruses.

AB We recently showed that mutations in the HIV-1 envelope (Env) destabilize the V3 loop, rendering neutralization-resistant viruses sensitive to V3-directed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Here, we investigated the propagation of this effect on other Env epitopes, with special emphasis on V2 loop exposure. Wild-type JR-FL and 19 mutant JR-FL pseudoviruses were tested for neutralization sensitivity to 21 MAbs specific for epitopes in V2, the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), and the CD4-induced (CD4i) region. Certain glycan mutants, mutations in the gp120 hydrophobic core, and mutations in residues involved in intraprotomer interactions exposed epitopes in the V2i region (which overlies the alpha 4 beta 7 integrin binding site) and the V3 crown, suggesting general destabilization of the distal region of the trimer apex. In contrast, other glycan mutants, mutations affecting interprotomer interactions, and mutations affecting the CD4bs exposed V3 but not V2i epitopes. These data indicate for the first time that V3 can move independently of V2, with V3 pivoting out from its "tucked" position in the trimer while apparently leaving the V2 apex intact. Notably, none of the mutations exposed V2 epitopes without also exposing V3, suggesting that movement of V2 releases V3. Most mutations increased sensitivity to CD4bs-directed MAbs without exposure of the CD4i epitope, implying these mutations facilitate the trimers' maintenance of an intermediate energy state between open and closed conformations. Taken together, these data indicate that several transient Env epitopes can be rendered more accessible to antibodies (Abs) via specific mutations, and this may facilitate the design of V1V2-targeting immunogens.
   IMPORTANCE Many epitopes of the HIV envelope (Env) spike are relatively inaccessible to antibodies (Abs) compared to their exposure in the open Env conformation induced by receptor binding. However, the reduced infection rate that resulted from the vaccine used in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial was correlated with the elicitation of V2-and V3-directed antibodies. Previously, we identified various mechanisms responsible for destabilizing the V3 loop; here, we determined, via mutation of numerous Env residues, which of these elements maintain the V1V2 loop in an inaccessible state and which expose V1V2 and/or V3 epitopes. Notably, our data indicate that V3 can move independently of V2, but none of the mutations studied expose V2 epitopes without also exposing V3. Additionally, V1V2 can be rendered more accessible to Abs via specific mutations, facilitating the development of engineered V2 immunogens.

AB The UL112-113 gene is one of the few alternatively spliced genes of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). It codes for four phosphoproteins, p34, p43, p50, and p84, all of which are expressed with early kinetics and accumulate at sites of viral DNA replication within the host cell nucleus. Although these proteins are known to play important, possibly essential, roles in the viral replication cycle, little is known about the contribution of individual UL112-113 protein products. Here we used splice site mutagenesis, intron deletion and substitution, and nonsense mutagenesis to prevent the individual expression of each UL112-113 protein isoform and to investigate the importance of each isoform for viral replication. We show that HCMV mutants lacking p34 or p50 expression replicated to high titers in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that these proteins are nonessential for viral replication, while mutant viruses carrying a stop mutation within the p84 coding sequence were severely growth impaired. Viral replication could not be detected upon the inactivation of p43 expression, indicating that this UL112-113 protein is essential for viral replication. We also analyzed the ability of UL112-113 proteins to recruit other viral proteins to intranuclear prereplication compartments. While UL112-113 expression was sufficient to recruit the UL44-encoded viral DNA polymerase processivity factor, it was not sufficient for the recruitment of the viral UL84 and UL117 proteins. Remarkably, both the p43 and p84 isoforms were required for the efficient recruitment of pUL44, which is consistent with their critical role in the viral life cycle.
   IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus requires gene products from 11 genetic loci for the lytic replication of its genome. One of these loci, UL112-113, encodes four proteins with common N termini by alternative splicing. In this study, we inactivated the expression of each of the four UL112-113 proteins individually and determined their requirement for HCMV replication. We found that two of the UL112-113 gene products were dispensable for viral replication in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In contrast, viral replication was severely reduced or absent when one of the other two gene products was inactivated, indicating that they are of crucial importance for the viral replication cycle. We further showed that the latter two gene products are involved in the recruitment of pUL44, an essential cofactor of the viral DNA polymerase, to specific sites within the cell nucleus that are thought to serve as starting points for viral DNA replication.

AB Mosquitoes harbor a high diversity of RNA viruses, including many that impact human health. Despite a growing effort to describe the extent and nature of the mosquito virome, little is known about how these viruses persist, spread, and interact with both their hosts and other microbes. To address this issue we performed a metatranscriptomics analysis of 12 Western Australian mosquito populations structured by species and geographic location. Our results identified the complete genomes of 24 species of RNA viruses from a diverse range of viral families and orders, among which 19 are newly described. Comparisons of viromes revealed a striking difference between the two mosquito genera, with viromes of mosquitoes of the Aedes genus exhibiting substantially less diversity and lower abundances than those of mosquitoes of the Culex genus, within which the viral abundance reached 16.87% of the total non-rRNA. In addition, there was little overlap in viral diversity between the two genera, although the viromes were very similar among the three Culex species studied, suggesting that the host taxon plays a major role in structuring virus diversity. In contrast, we found no evidence that geographic location played a major role in shaping RNA virus diversity, and several viruses discovered here exhibited high similarity (95 to 98% nucleotide identity) to those from Indonesia and China. Finally, using abundance-level and phylogenetic relationships, we were able to distinguish potential mosquito viruses from those present in coinfecting bacteria, fungi, and protists. In sum, our metatranscriptomics approach provides important insights into the ecology of mosquito RNA viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Studies of virus ecology have generally focused on individual viral species. However, recent advances in bulk RNA sequencing make it possible to utilize metatranscriptomic approaches to reveal both complete virus diversity and the relative abundance of these viruses. We used such a metatranscriptomic approach to determine key aspects of the ecology of mosquito viruses in Western Australia. Our results show that RNA viruses are some of the most important components of the mosquito transcriptome, and we identified 19 new virus species from a diverse set of virus families. A key result was that host genetic background plays a more important role in shaping virus diversity than sampling location, with Culex species harboring more viruses at higher abundance than those from Aedes mosquitoes.

AB Given the limited set of T cell receptor (TCR) V genes that are used to create TCRs that are reactive to different ligands, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, and MHC-like proteins (for example, MIC molecules and CD1 molecules), the V delta 1 segment can be rearranged with D delta-J delta-C delta or J alpha-C alpha segments to form classical gamma delta TCRs or uncommon alpha beta TCRs using a V delta 1 segment (delta/alpha beta TCR). Here we have determined two complex structures of the delta/alpha beta TCRs (S19-2 and TU55) bound to different locus-disparate MHC class I molecules with HIV peptides (HLA-A*2402-Nef138-10 and HLA-B*3501-Pol448-9). The overall binding modes resemble those of classical gamma beta TCRs but display a strong tilt binding geometry of the V delta 1 domain toward the HLA alpha 1 helix, due to a conserved extensive interaction between the CDR1 delta loop and the N-terminal region of the alpha 1 helix (mainly in position 62). The aromatic amino acids of the CDR1 delta loop exploit different conformations ("aromatic ladder" or "aromatic hairpin") to accommodate distinct MHC helical scaffolds. This tolerance helps to explain how a particular TCR V region can similarly dock onto multiple MHC molecules and thus may potentially explain the nature of TCR cross-reactivity. In addition, the length of the CDR3 delta loop could affect the extent of tilt binding of the V delta 1 domain, and adaptively, the pairing V beta domains adjust their mass centers to generate differential MHC contacts, hence probably ensuring TCR specificity for a certain peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I). Our data have provided further structural insights into the TCR recognition of classical pMHC-I molecules, unifying cross-reactivity and specificity.
   IMPORTANCE The specificity of alpha beta T cell recognition is determined by the CDR loops of the alpha beta TCR, and the general mode of binding of alpha beta TCRs to pMHC has been established over the last decade. Due to the intrinsic genomic structure of the TCR alpha/beta chain locus, some V delta segments can rearrange with the C alpha segment, forming a hybrid V delta C alpha V beta C beta TCR, the delta/alpha beta TCR. However, the basis for the molecular recognition of such TCRs of their ligands is elusive. Here an alpha beta TCR using the V delta 1 segment, S19-2, was isolated from an HIV-infected patient in an HLA-A*24:02-restricted man ner. We then solved the crystal structures of the S19-2 TCR and another delta/alpha beta TCR, TU55, bound to their respective ligands, revealing a conserved V delta 1 binding feature. Further binding kinetics analysis revealed that the S19-2 and TU55 TCRs bind pHLA very tightly and in a long-lasting manner. Our results illustrate the mode of binding of a TCR using the V delta 1 segment to its ligand, virus-derived pHLA.

TI Critical Role for Monocytes/Macrophages in Rapid Progression to AIDS in
   Pediatric Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Rhesus Macaques

AB Infant humans and rhesus macaques infected with the human or simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV or SIV), respectively, express higher viral loads and progress more rapidly to AIDS than infected adults. Activated memory CD4(+) T cells in intestinal tissues are major primary target cells for SIV/HIV infection, and massive depletion of these cells is considered a major cause of immunodeficiency. Monocytes and macrophages are important cells of innate immunity and also are targets of HIV/SIV infection. We reported previously that a high peripheral blood monocyte turnover rate was predictive for the onset of disease progression to AIDS in SIV-infected adult macaques. The purpose of this study was to determine if earlier or higher infection of monocytes/macrophages contributes to the more rapid progression to AIDS in infants. We observed that uninfected infant rhesus macaques exhibited higher physiologic baseline monocyte turnover than adults. Early after SIV infection, the monocyte turnover further increased, and it remained high during progression to AIDS. A high percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end label (TUNEL)-positive macrophages in the lymph nodes (LNs) and intestine corresponded with an increasing number of macrophages derived from circulating monocytes (bromodeoxyuridine positive [BrdU(+)] CD163(+)), suggesting that the increased blood monocyte turnover was required to rapidly replenish destroyed tissue macrophages. Immunofluorescence analysis further demonstrated that macrophages were a significant portion of the virus-producing cells found in LNs, intestinal tissues, and lungs. The higher baseline monocyte turnover in infant macaques and subsequent macrophage damage by SIV infection may help explain the basis of more rapid disease progression to AIDS in infants.
   IMPORTANCE HIV infection progresses much more rapidly in pediatric cases than in adults; however, the mechanism for this difference is unclear. Using the rhesus macaque model, this work was performed to address why infants infected with SIV progress more quickly to AIDS than do adults. Earlier we reported that in adult rhesus macaques, increasing monocyte turnover reflected tissue macrophage damage by SIV and was predictive of terminal disease progression to AIDS. Here we report that uninfected infant rhesus macaques exhibited a higher physiological baseline monocyte turnover rate than adults. Furthermore, once infected with SIV, infants displayed further increased monocyte turnover that may have facilitated the accelerated progression to AIDS. These results support a role for monocytes and macro-phages in the pathogenesis of SIV/HIV and begin to explain why infants are more prone to rapid disease progression.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus that is highly prevalent in almost all human populations and is associated with many human cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin's disease, and gastric carcinoma. However, in these EBV-associated cancers, only NPC exhibits remarkable ethnic and geographic distribution. We hypothesized that EBV genomic variations might contribute to the pathogenesis of different human cancers in different geographic areas. In this study, we collected 18 NPC biopsy specimens from the Hunan Province in southern China and de novo assembled 18 NPC biopsy specimen-derived EBV (NPC-EBV) genomes, designated HN1 to HN18. This was achieved through target enrichment of EBV DNA by hybridization, followed by next-generation sequencing, to reveal sequence diversity. These EBV genomes harbored 20,570 variations totally, including 20,328 substitutions, 88 insertions, and 154 deletions, compared to the EBV reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all NPC-EBV genomes were distinct from other EBV genomes. Furthermore, HN1 to HN18 had some nonsynonymous variations in EBV genes including genes encoding latent, early lytic, and tegument proteins, such as substitutions within transmembrane domains 1 and 3 of LMP1, FoP_duplication, and zf-AD domains of ENBA1, in addition to aberrations in noncoding regions, especially in BamHI A rightward transcript microRNAs. These variations might have potential biological significance. In conclusion, we reported a genome-wide view of sequence variation in EBV isolated from primary NPC biopsy specimens obtained from the Hunan Province. This might contribute to further understanding of how genomic variations contribute to carcinogenesis, which would impact the treatment of EBV-associated cancer.
   IMPORTANCE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and exhibits remarkable ethnic and geographic distribution. Hunan Province in southern China has a high incidence rate of NPCs. Here, we report 18 novel EBV genome sequences from viruses isolated from primary NPC biopsy specimens in this region, revealing whole-genome sequence diversity.

AB Understanding whether the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response impacts HIV-1 superinfection and how superinfection subsequently modulates the NAb response can help clarify correlates of protection from HIV exposures and better delineate pathways of NAb development. We examined associations between the development of NAb and the occurrence of superinfection in a well-characterized, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, primary infection cohort of men who have sex with men. Deep sequencing was applied to blood plasma samples from the cohort to detect cases of superinfection. We compared the NAb activity against autologous and heterologous viruses between 10 participants with intrasubtype B superinfection and 19 monoinfected controls, matched to duration of infection and risk behavior. Three to 6 months after primary infection, individuals who would later become superinfected had significantly weaker NAb activity against tier 1 subtype B viruses (P = 0.003 for SF-162 and P = 0.017 for NL4-3) and marginally against autologous virus (P = 0.054). Lower presuperinfection NAb responses correlated with weaker gp120 binding and lower plasma total IgG titers. Soon after superinfection, the NAb response remained lower, but between 2 and 3 years after primary infection, NAb levels strengthened and reached those of controls. Superinfecting viruses were typically not susceptible to neutralization by presuperinfection plasma. These observations suggest that recently infected individuals with a delayed NAb response against primary infecting and tier 1 subtype B viruses are more susceptible to superinfection. IMPORTANCE Our findings suggest that within the first year after HIV infection, a relatively weak neutralizing antibody response against primary and subtype-specific neutralization-sensitive viruses increases susceptibility to superinfection in the face of repeated exposures. As natural infection progresses, the immune response strengthens significantly in some superinfected individuals. These findings will inform HIV vaccine design by providing testable correlates of protection from initial HIV infection.

AB Although shrews are one of the largest groups of mammals, little is known about their role in the evolution and transmission of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). We captured 266 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which we denote Wencheng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.
   IMPORTANCE The subfamily Coronavirinae contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wencheng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and longstanding hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.

TI Human Bocavirus 1 Is a Novel Helper for Adeno-associated Virus

AB Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is an autonomous parvovirus that infects well-differentiated primary human airway epithelia (HAE) in vitro. In human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, the transfection of a duplex HBoV1 genome initiates viral DNA replication and produces progeny virions that are infectious in HAE. HBoV1 takes advantage of signaling pathways in the DNA damage response for efficient genome amplification in both well-differentiated (nondividing) HAE and dividing HEK293 cells. On the other hand, adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) is a helper-dependent dependoparvovirus, and productive AAV2 replication requires coinfection with a helper virus (e.g., adenovirus or herpesvirus) or treatment with genotoxic agents. Here, we report that HBoV1 is a novel helper virus for AAV2 replication. Coinfection by HBoV1 and AAV2 rescued AAV2 replication in HAE cells. The helper function of HBoV1 for AAV2 is not limited to HAE cells but also includes HEK293 and HeLa cells. Importantly, the helper function of HBoV1 for AAV2 relies on neither HBoV1 replication nor the DNA damage response. Following transfection of HEK293 cells, the minimal requirements for the replication of the AAV2 duplex DNA genome and the production of progeny virions included the HBoV1 NP1 and NS4 proteins and a newly identified viral long noncoding RNA (BocaSR). However, following infection of HEK293 and HeLa cells with AAV2 virions, HBoV1 NS2 (but not NS4), NP1, and BocaSR were required for AAV2 DNA replication and progeny virion formation. These new methods for packaging the AAV2 genome may be useful for generating recombinant AAV-packaging cell lines and the directed evolution of AAV capsids.
   IMPORTANCE We first report that an autonomous parvovirus, HBoV1, helps the replication of a dependoparvovirus, AAV2, in differentiated human airway epithelia. We identified the minimal sets of HBoV1 genes required to facilitate the replication of the AAV2 duplex genome and for AAV2 infection. Notably, together with the expression of the NP1 and BocaSR genes, HBoV1 NS2 is required for the productive infection of HEK293 and HeLa cells by AAV2, whereas NS4 is sufficient for viral DNA replication of an AAV2 duplex genome. The identification of HBoV1 as a helper virus for AAV2 replication has implications for the improvement of recombinant AAV production in HEK293 cells and cell types that do not express the adenovirus E1 gene as well as for the rescue of wild-type AAV genomes from tissues during directed evolution in the absence of wild-type adenovirus. A further understanding of the mechanism underlying HBoV1 helper-dependent AAV2 replication may also provide in-sights into its functions in HBoV1 replication.

AB A detailed understanding of the fine specificity of serotype-specific human antibodies is vital for the development and evaluation of new vaccines for pathogenic flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus. In this study, we thoroughly characterize the structural footprint of an anti-idiotype antibody (E1) specific for a potent, fully human DENV serotype 1-specific antibody, termed HM14c10, derived from a recovered patient. The crystal structure at a resolution of 2.5 angstrom of a complex between the Fab fragments of E1 and HM14c10 provides the first detailed molecular comparison of an anti-idiotype paratope specific for a human antibody with its analogous epitope, a discontinuous quaternary structure located at the surface of the viral particle that spans adjacent envelope (E) proteins. This comparison reveals that the footprints left by E1 and E on HM14c10 largely overlap, explaining why the formation of binary complexes is mutually exclusive. Structural mimicry of the DENV E epitope by the E1 combining site is achieved via the formation of numerous interactions with heavy chain complementarity domain regions (CDRs) of HM14c10, while fewer interactions are observed with its light chain than for the E protein. We show that E1 can be utilized to detect HM14c10-like antibodies in sera from patients who recovered from DENV-1, infection suggesting that this is a public (common) idiotype. These data demonstrate the utility of employing an anti-idiotype antibody to monitor a patient's specific immune responses and suggest routes for the improvement of E "mimicry" by E1 by increasing its recognition of the Fab HM14c10 light chain CDRs.
   IMPORTANCE A chimeric yellow fever-dengue live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine is now being marketed. Dengue remains a significant public health problem, because protection conferred by this vaccine against the four circulating serotypes is uneven. Reliable tools must be developed to measure the immune responses of individuals exposed to DENV either via viral infection or through vaccination. Anti-idiotypic anti-bodies provide precision tools for analyzing the pharmacokinetics of antibodies in an immune response and also for measuring the amount of circulating anti-infective therapeutic antibodies. Here, we characterize how an anti-idiotypic antibody (E1) binds antibody HM14c10, which potently neutralizes DENV serotype 1. We report the crystal structure at a resolution of 2.5 angstrom of a complex between the Fab fragments of E1 and HM14c10 and provide the first detailed molecular comparison between the anti-idiotype surface and its analogous epitope located at the surface of the dengue virus particle.

AB Fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a tumor disease of marine turtles associated with chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5), which has historically been refractory to growth in tissue culture. Here we show, for the first time, de novo formation of ChHV5-positive intranuclear inclusions in cultured green turtle cells, which is indicative of active lytic replication of the virus. The minimal requirements to achieve lytic replication in cultured cells included (i) either in vitro cultures of ChHV5-positive tumor biopsy specimens (plugs) or organotypic cultures (rafts) consisting of ChHV5-positive turtle fibroblasts in collagen rafts seeded with turtle keratinocytes and (ii) keratinocyte maturation induced by raising raft or biopsy cultures to the air-liquid interface. Virus growth was confirmed by detailed electron microscopic studies that revealed intranuclear sun-shaped capsid factories, tubules, various stages of capsid formation, nuclear export by budding into the perinuclear space, tegument formation, and envelopment to complete de novo virus production. Membrane synthesis was also observed as a sign of active viral replication. Interestingly, cytoplasmic particles became associated with keratin filaments, a feature not seen in conventional monolayer cell cultures, in which most studies of herpesvirus replication have been performed. Our findings draw a rich and realistic picture of ChHV5 replication in cells derived from its natural host and may be crucial not only to better understand ChHV5 circulation but also to eventually complete Koch's postulates for FP. Moreover, the principles described here may serve as a model for culture of other viruses that are resistant to replication in conventional cell culture.
   IMPORTANCE A major challenge in virology is the study of viruses that cannot be grown in the laboratory. One example is chelonid herpesvirus 5 (ChHV5), which is associated with fibropapillomatosis, a globally distributed, debilitating, and fatal tumor disease of endangered marine turtles. Pathological examination shows that ChHV5 is shed in skin. Here we show that ChHV5 will grow in vitro if we replicate the complex three-dimensional structure of turtle skin. Moreover, lytic virus growth requires a close interplay between fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Finally, the morphogenesis of herpesviral growth in three-dimensional cultures reveals a far richer, and likely more realistic, array of capsid morphologies than that encountered in traditional monolayer cell cultures. Our findings have applications to other viruses, including those of humans.

AB HIV-1 Nef clones isolated from a rare subset of HIV-1-infected elite controllers (EC), with the ability to suppress viral load to undetectable levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, are unable to fully downregulate CD4 from the plasma membrane of CD4(+) T cells. Residual CD4 left at the plasma membrane allows Env-CD4 interaction, which leads to increased exposure of Env CD4-induced epitopes and increases susceptibility of infected cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is mediated largely by natural killer (NK) cells, which control their activation status through the cumulative signals received through activating and inhibitory receptors. Recently, the activating NKG2D receptor was demonstrated to positively influence ADCC responses. Since HIV-1 Nef has been reported to reduce the expression of NKG2D ligands, we evaluated the relative abilities of Nef from EC and progressors to downmodulate NKG2D ligands. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of EC and progressor Nef on the ADCC susceptibility of HIV-1infected cells. We observed a significantly increased expression of NKG2D ligands on cells infected with viruses coding for Nef from EC. Importantly, NKG2D ligand expression levels correlated with enhanced susceptibility of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC. The biological significance of this correlation was corroborated by the demonstration that antibody-mediated blockade of NKG2D significantly reduced ADCC of cells infected with viruses carrying Nef from EC. These results suggest the involvement of NKG2D-NKG2D ligand interactions in the enhanced susceptibility of EC HIV1-infected cells to ADCC responses.
   IMPORTANCE Attenuated Nef functions have been reported in HIV-1 isolated from EC. The inability of elite controller Nef to fully remove CD4 from the surface of infected cells enhanced their susceptibility to elimination by ADCC. We now show that downregulation of NKG2D ligands by HIV-1 Nef from EC is inefficient and leaves infected cells susceptible to ADCC. These data suggest a critical role for NKG2D ligands in anti-HIV-1 ADCC responses.

AB Mutational escape of HIV-1 from HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) is a major barrier for effective immune control. Each epitope typically is targeted by multiple clones with distinct T cell receptors (TCRs). While the clonal repertoire may be important for containing epitope variation, determinants of its composition are poorly understood. We investigate the clonal repertoire of 29 CTL responses against 23 HIV-1 epitopes longitudinally in nine chronically infected untreated subjects with plasma viremia of <3,000 RNA copies/ml over 17 to 179 weeks. The composition of TCRs targeting each epitope varied considerably in stability over time, although clonal stability (Sorensen index) was not significantly time dependent within this interval. However, TCR stability inversely correlated with epitope variability in the Los Alamos HIV-1 Sequence Database, consistent with TCR evolution being driven by epitope variation. Finally, a robust inverse correlation of TCR breadth against each epitope versus epitope variability further suggested that this variability drives TCR repertoire diversification. In the context of studies demonstrating rapidly shifting HIV-1 sequences in vivo, our findings support a variably dynamic process of shifting CTL clonality lagging in tandem with viral evolution and suggest that preventing escape of HIV-1 may require coordinated direction of the CTL clonal repertoire to simultaneously block escape pathways.
   IMPORTANCE Mutational escape of HIV-1 from HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) is a major barrier to effective immune control. The number of distinct CTL clones targeting each epitope is proposed to be an important factor, but the determinants are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the clonal stability and number of clones for the CTL response against an epitope are inversely associated with the general variability of the epitope. These results show that CTLs constantly lag epitope mutation, suggesting that preventing HIV-1 escape may require coordinated direction of the CTL clonal repertoire to simultaneously block escape pathways.

AB Research on vaccine approaches that can provide long-term protection against dengue virus infection is needed. Here we describe the construction, immunogenicity, and preliminary information on the protective capacity of recombinant, replication-competent rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV), a persisting herpesvirus. One RRV construct expressed nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), while a second recombinant expressed a soluble variant of the E protein (E85) of dengue virus 2 (DENV2). Four rhesus macaques received a single vaccination with a mixture of both recombinant RRVs and were subsequently challenged 19 weeks later with 1 x 10(5) PFU of DENV2. During the vaccine phase, plasma of all vaccinated monkeys showed neutralizing activity against DENV2. Cellular immune responses against NS5 were also elicited, as evidenced by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) tetramer staining in the one vaccinated monkey that was Mamu-A*01 positive. Unlike two of two unvaccinated controls, two of the four vaccinated monkeys showed no detectable viral RNA sequences in plasma after challenge. One of these two monkeys also showed no anamnestic increases in antibody levels following challenge and thus appeared to be protected against the acquisition of DENV2 following high-dose challenge. Continued study will be needed to evaluate the performance of herpesviral and other persisting vectors for achieving long-term protection against dengue virus infection.
   IMPORTANCE Continuing studies of vaccine approaches against dengue virus (DENV) infection are warranted, particularly ones that may provide long-term immunity against all four serotypes. Here we investigated whether recombinant rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) could be used as a vaccine against DENV2 infection in rhesus monkeys. Upon vaccination, all animals generated antibodies capable of neutralizing DENV2. Two of four vaccinated monkeys showed no detectable viral RNA after subsequent high-dose DENV2 challenge at 19 weeks postvaccination. Furthermore, one of these vaccinated monkeys appeared to be protected against the acquisition of DENV2 infection on the basis of undetectable viral loads and the lack of an anamnestic antibody response. These findings underscore the potential utility of recombinant herpesviruses as vaccine vectors.

AB In this study, we investigated the effect of acetate, the most concentrated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) in the gut and bloodstream, on the susceptibility of primary human CD4(+) T cells to HIV-1 infection. We report that HIV-1 replication is increased in CD3/CD28-costimulated CD4(+) T cells upon acetate treatment. This enhancing effect correlates with increased expression of the early activation marker CD69 and impaired class I/II histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. In addition, acetate enhances acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and augments HIV-1 integration into the genome of CD4(+) T cells. Thus, we propose that upon antigen presentation, acetate influences class I/II HDAC activity that transforms condensed chromatin into a more relaxed structure. This event leads to a higher level of viral integration and enhanced HIV-1 production. In line with previous studies showing reactivation of latent HIV-1 by SCFAs, we provide evidence that acetate can also increase the susceptibility of primary human CD4(+) T cells to productive HIV-1 infection.
   IMPORTANCE Alterations in the fecal microbiota and intestinal epithelial damage involved in the gastrointestinal disorder associated with HIV-1 infection result in microbial translocation that leads to disease progression and virus-related comorbidities. Indeed, notably via production of short-chain fatty acids, bacteria migrating from the lumen to the intestinal mucosa could influence HIV-1 replication by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as histone acetylation. We demonstrate that acetate enhances virus production in primary human CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, we report that acetate impairs class I/II histone deacetylase activity and increases integration of HIV-1 DNA into the host genome. Therefore, it can be postulated that bacterial metabolites such as acetate modulate HIV-1-mediated disease progression.

AB SFTS phlebovirus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that was first reported in China in 2009. Here we report the generation of a recombinant SFTSV (rHB29NSsKO) that cannot express the viral nonstructural protein (NSs) upon infection of cells in culture. We show that rHB29NSsKO replication kinetics are greater in interferon (IFN)-incompetent cells and that the virus is unable to suppress IFN induced in response to viral replication. The data confirm for the first time in the context of virus infection that NSs acts as a virally encoded IFN antagonist and that NSs is dispensable for virus replication. Using 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we mapped the 3' end of the N and NSs mRNAs, showing that the mRNAs terminate within the coding region of the opposite open reading frame. We show that the 3' end of the N mRNA terminates upstream of a 5'-GCCAGCC-3' motif present in the viral genomic RNA. With this knowledge, and using virus-like particles, we could demonstrate that the last 36 nucleotides of the NSs open reading frame (ORF) were needed to ensure the efficient termination of the N mRNA and were required for recombinant virus rescue. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover viruses lacking NSs (expressing just a 12-amino-acid NSs peptide or encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP]) or an NSs-eGFP fusion protein in the NSs locus. This opens the possibility for further studies of NSs and potentially the design of attenuated viruses for vaccination studies.

AB Paramyxoviruses rely on the matrix (M) protein to orchestrate viral assembly and budding at the plasma membrane. Although the mechanistic details remain largely unknown, structural data suggested that M dimers and/or higher-order oligomers may facilitate membrane budding. To gain functional insights, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach to investigate the role of canine distemper virus (CDV) M protein self-assembly in membrane-budding activity. Three six-alanine-block (6A-block) mutants with mutations located at strategic oligomeric positions were initially designed. While the first one includes residues potentially residing at the protomer-protomer interface, the other two display amino acids located within two distal surface-exposed alpha-helices proposed to be involved in dimer-dimer contacts. We further focused on the core of the dimeric interface by mutating asparagine 138 (N138) to several nonconservative amino acids. Cellular localization combined with dimerization and coimmunopurification assays, performed under various denaturing conditions, revealed that all 6A-block mutants were impaired in self-assembly and cell periphery accumulation. These phenotypes correlated with deficiencies in relocating CDV nucleocapsid proteins to the cell periphery and in virus-like particle (VLP) production. Conversely, all M-N138 mutants remained capable of self-assembly, though to various extents, which correlated with proper accumulation and redistribution of nucleocapsid proteins at the plasma membrane. However, membrane deformation and VLP assays indicated that the M-N138 variants exhibiting the most reduced dimerization propensity were also defective in triggering membrane remodeling and budding, despite proper plasma membrane accumulation. Overall, our data provide mechanistic evidence that the efficiency of CDV M dimerization/oligomerization governs both cell periphery localization and membrane-budding activity.
   IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of effective vaccines, both measles virus (MeV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) still lead to significant human and animal mortality worldwide. It is assumed that postexposure prophylaxis with specific antiviral compounds may synergize with vaccination campaigns to better control ongoing epidemics. Targeting the matrix (M) protein of MeV/CDV is attractive, because M coordinates viral assembly and egress through interaction with multiple cellular and viral components. However, the lack of basic molecular knowledge of how M orchestrates these functions precludes the rational design of antivirals. Here we combined structure-guided mutagenesis with cellular, biochemical, and functional assays to investigate a potential correlation between CDV M self-assembly and virus-like particle (VLP) formation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence that stable M dimers at the cell periphery are required to productively trigger VLPs. Such stabilized M dimeric units may facilitate further assembly into robust higher-order oligomers necessary to promote plasma membrane-budding activity.

AB The stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) is a broad antimicrobial factor that restricts herpes simplex virus (HSV) by activating type I interferon and proinflammatory responses upon sensing of foreign DNA. UL46 is one of the most abundant tegument proteins of HSV-1, but a well-established function has yet to be found. We found that the HSV-1 UL46 protein interacts with and colocalizes with STING. A Delta UL46 virus displayed growth defects and activated innate immunity, but both effects were alleviated in STING knockdown cells. UL46 was also required for the inhibition of the 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-dependent immune responses during infection. In cells expressing UL46, out of the context of the infection, innate immunity to a Delta ICP0 virus was largely compromised, and that permitted ICP0-deficient mutants to replicate. The UL46-expressing cell lines also rescued the defects of the Delta UL46 virus and enhanced wild-type virus infection. The UL46-expressing cell lines did not activate interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription following treatment with the non-canonical cyclic dinucleotide 2',3'-cGAMP, suggesting that the STING pathway may be compromised. Indeed, we found that both proteins STING and IFI16 were eliminated in cells constitutively expressing UL46 and that the accumulation of their transcripts was blocked. Finally, we demonstrated that UL46 via its N terminus binds to STING and, via its C terminus, to TBK1. These interactions appear to modulate the functions of STING during HSV-1 infection. Taken together, our studies describe a novel function for one of the least-studied proteins of HSV, the tegument protein UL46, and that function involves the evasion of foreign DNA-sensing pathways.
   IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) afflicts 80% of the population worldwide, causing various diseases. After initial infection, the virus establishes latent reservoirs in sensory neurons and persists for life. Here we describe novel interactions between HSV-1 and the DNA sensor STING. We found that (i) HSV-1 tegument protein UL46 interacts with and colocalizes with STING; (ii) UL46 expressed out of the context of the infection blocks type I interferon triggered by STING stimuli, through the elimination of STING and of interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16); (iii) a Delta UL46 virus displayed growth defects, which were rescued in STING knockdown cells; (iv) the Delta UL46 virus failed to block innate immunity triggered by ligands of STING such as 2', 3'-cGAMP and also activated IFN-beta and ISG expression; and (v) UL46 binds to both STING and TBK1 through different domains. We conclude that UL46 counteracts the actions of STING during HSV-1 infection.

AB During infectious entry, acidification within the endosome triggers uncoating of the human papillomavirus (HPV) capsid, whereupon host cyclophilins facilitate the release of most of the major capsid protein, L1, from the minor capsid protein L2 and the viral genome. The L2/DNA complex traffics to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). After the onset of mitosis, HPV-harboring transport vesicles bud from the TGN, followed by association with mitotic chromosomes. During this time, the HPV genome remains in a vesicular compartment until the nucleus has completely reformed. Recent data suggest that while most of L1 protein dissociates and is degraded in the endosome, some L1 protein remains associated with the viral genome. The L1 protein has DNA binding activity, and the L2 protein has multiple domains capable of interacting with L1 capsomeres. In this study, we report that some L1 protein traffics with L2 and viral genome to the nucleus. The accompanying L1 protein is mostly full length and retains conformation-dependent epitopes, which are recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Since more than one L1 molecule contributes to these epitopes and requires assembly into capsomeres, we propose that L1 protein is present in the form of pentamers. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the L1 protein interacts directly with viral DNA within the capsid. Based on our findings, we propose that the L1 protein, likely arranged as capsomeres, stabilizes the viral genome within the subviral complex during intracellular trafficking.
   IMPORTANCE After internalization, the nonenveloped human papillomavirus virion uncoats in the endosome, whereupon conformational changes result in a dissociation of a subset of the major capsid protein L1 from the minor capsid protein L2, which remains in complex with the viral DNA. Recent data suggest that some L1 protein may accompany the viral genome beyond the endosomal compartment. We demonstrate that conformationally intact L1 protein, likely still arranged as capsomeres, remains associated with the incoming viral genome throughout mitosis and transiently resides in the nucleus until after the viral DNA is released from the transport vesicle.

   ESTABLISHMENT
AB Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is widespread in the human population. Following orofacial infection, HSV establishes latency in innervating sensory neurons, primarily located in the trigeminal ganglia. A central feature of HSV pathogenesis is the ability to periodically reactivate in those neurons and be transported back to the body surface. Both transmission and disease, such as keratitis, encephalitis, and neurodegeneration, have been linked to reactivation. Despite invaluable insights obtained from model systems, interactions between viral and host functions that regulate reactivation are still incompletely understood. Various assays are used for measuring reactivation in animal models, but there have been limited comparisons between methods and the accuracy of detecting the timing of reactivation and the corresponding amount of infectious virus produced in the ganglia per reactivation event. Here, we directly compare two approaches for measuring reactivation in latently infected explanted ganglia by sampling media from the explanted cultures or by homogenization of the ganglia and compare the results to viral protein expression in the whole ganglia. We show that infectious virus detection by direct homogenization of explanted ganglia correlates with viral protein expression, but detection of infectious virus in medium samples from explanted cultures does not occur until extensive spread of virus is observed in the ganglia. The medium-sampling method is therefore not reflective of the initial timing of reactivation, and the additional variables influencing spread of virus in the ganglia should be considered when interpreting results obtained using this method.
   IMPORTANCE The development of treatments to prevent and/or treat HSV infection rely upon understanding viral and host factors that influence reactivation. Progress is dependent on experimental methods that accurately measure the frequency and timing of reactivation in latently infected neurons. In this study, two methods for detecting reactivation using the explant model are compared. We show through direct tissue homogenization that reactivation occurs much earlier than can be detected by the indirect method of sampling media from explanted cultures. Thus, the sampling method does not detect the initial timing of reactivation, and results obtained using this method are subject to additional variables with the potential to obscure reactivation outcomes.

AB Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising oncolytic virus (OV). Although VSV is effective against a majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell (PDAC) cell lines, some PDAC cell lines are highly resistant to VSV, and the mechanisms of resistance are still unclear. JAK1/2 inhibitors (such as ruxolitinib and JAK inhibitor I) strongly stimulate VSV replication and oncolysis in all resistant cell lines but only partially improve the susceptibility of resistant PDACs to VSV. VSV tumor tropism is generally dependent on the permissiveness of malignant cells to viral replication rather than on receptor specificity, with several ubiquitously expressed cell surface molecules playing a role in VSV attachment to host cells. However, as VSV attachment to PDAC cells has never been tested before, here we examined if it was possibly inhibited in resistant PDAC cells. Our data show a dramatically weaker attachment of VSV to HPAF-II cells, the most resistant human PDAC cell line. Although sequence analysis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) mRNA did not reveal any amino acid substitutions in this cell line, HPAF-II cells displayed the lowest level of LDLR expression and dramatically lower LDL uptake. Treatment of cells with various statins strongly increased LDLR expression levels but did not improve VSV attachment or LDL uptake in HPAF-II cells. However, LDLR-independent attachment of VSV to HPAF-II cells was dramatically improved by treating cells with Polybrene or DEAE-dextran. Moreover, combining VSV with ruxolitinib and Polybrene or DEAE-dextran successfully broke the resistance of HPAF-II cells to VSV by simultaneously improving VSV attachment and replication.
   IMPORTANCE Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is an anticancer approach that uses viruses that selectively infect and kill cancer cells. This study focuses on oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Although VSV is effective against most PDAC cells, some are highly resistant to VSV, and the mechanisms are still unclear. Here we examined if VSV attachment to cells was inhibited in resistant PDAC cells. Our data show very inefficient attachment of VSV to the most resistant human PDAC cell line, HPAF-II. However, VSV attachment to HPAF-II cells was dramatically improved by treating cells with polycations. Moreover, combining VSV with polycations and ruxolitinib (which inhibits antiviral signaling) successfully broke the resistance of HPAF-II cells to VSV by simultaneously improving VSV attachment and replication. We envision that this novel triple-combination approach could be used in the future to treat PDAC tumors that are highly resistant to OV therapy.

AB The invention of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques marked the coming of a new era in the detection of the genetic diversity of intrahost viral populations. A good understanding of the genetic structure of these populations requires, first, the ability to identify the different isolates or variants and, second, the ability to accurately quantify them. However, the initial amplification step of NGS studies can impose potential quantitative biases, modifying the variant relative frequencies. In particular, the number of target molecules (NTM) used during the amplification step is vastly overlooked although of primary importance, as it sets the limit of the accuracy and sensitivity of the sequencing procedure. In the present article, we investigated quantitative biases in an NGS study of populations of a multipartite single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus at different steps of the procedure. We studied 20 independent populations of the ssDNA virus faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) in two host plants, Vicia faba and Medicago truncatula. FBNSV is a multipartite virus composed of eight genomic segments, whose specific and host-dependent relative frequencies are defined as the "genome formula." Our results show a significant distortion of the FBNSV genome formula after the amplification and sequencing steps. We also quantified the genetic bottleneck occurring at the amplification step by documenting the NTM of two genomic segments of FBNSV. We argue that the NTM must be documented and carefully considered when determining the sensitivity and accuracy of data from NGS studies.
   IMPORTANCE The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques now enables study of the genetic diversity of viral populations. A good understanding of the genetic structure of these populations first requires the ability to identify the different isolates or variants and second requires the ability to accurately quantify them. Prior to sequencing, viral genomes need to be amplified, a step that potentially imposes quantitative biases and modifies the viral population structure. In particular, the number of target molecules (NTM) used during the amplification step is of primary importance, as it sets the limit of the accuracy and sensitivity of the sequencing procedure. In this work, we used 20 replicated populations of the multipartite faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV) to estimate the various limitations of ultradeep-sequencing studies performed on intrahost viral populations. We report quantitative biases during rolling-circle amplification and the NTM of two genomic segments of FBNSV.

AB Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus. Segment A contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), which encode viral proteins VP2, VP3, VP4, and VP5. Segment B contains one ORF and encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP1. IBDV ribonucleoprotein complexes are composed of VP1, VP3, and dsRNA and play a critical role in mediating viral replication and transcription during the virus life cycle. In the present study, we identified a cellular factor, VDAC1, which was upregulated during IBDV infection and found to mediate IBDV polymerase activity. VDAC1 senses IBDV infection by interacting with viral proteins VP1 and VP3. This association is caused by RNA bridging, and all three proteins colocalize in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of VDAC1 resulted in a reduction in viral polymerase activity and a subsequent decrease in viral yield. Moreover, overexpression of VDAC1 enhanced IBDV polymerase activity. We also found that the viral protein VP3 can replace segment A to execute polymerase activity. A previous study showed that mutations in the C terminus of VP3 directly influence the formation of VP1-VP3 complexes. Our immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that protein-protein interactions between VDAC1 and VP3 and between VDAC1 and VP1 play a role in stabilizing the interaction between VP3 and VP1, further promoting IBDV polymerase activity.

TI Ebola Virus Delta Peptide Is a Viroporin

AB The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome encodes a partly conserved 40-residue nonstructural polypeptide, called the delta peptide, that is produced in abundance during Ebola virus disease (EVD). The function of the delta peptide is unknown, but sequence analysis has suggested that delta peptide could be a viroporin, belonging to a diverse family of membrane-permeabilizing small polypeptides involved in replication and pathogenesis of numerous viruses. Full-length and conserved C-terminal delta peptide fragments permeabilize the plasma membranes of nucleated cells of rodent, dog, monkey, and human origin; increase ion permeability across confluent cell monolayers; and permeabilize synthetic lipid bilayers. Permeabilization activity is completely dependent on the disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines. The conserved C-terminal portion of the peptide is biochemically stable in human serum, and most serum-stable fragments have full activity. Taken together, the evidence strongly suggests that Ebola virus delta peptide is a viroporin and that it may be a novel, targetable aspect of Ebola virus disease pathology.
   IMPORTANCE During the unparalleled West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) that began in late 2013, the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in chains of serial infection and a high mortality rate among infected patients. A better understanding of disease pathology is desperately needed to develop better countermeasures. We show here that the Ebola virus delta peptide, a conserved nonstructural protein produced in large quantities by infected cells, has the characteristics of a viroporin. This information suggests a critical role for the delta peptide in Ebola virus disease pathology and as a possible target for novel countermeasures.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has recently emerged as an important human pathogen with increasing economic and health impact worldwide. Because of its teratogenic nature and association with the serious neurological condition Guillain-Barre syndrome, a tremendous amount of effort has focused on understanding ZIKV pathogenesis. To gain further insights into ZIKV interaction with host cells, we investigated how this pathogen affects stress response pathways. While ZIKV infection induces stress signaling that leads to phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha and cellular translational arrest, stress granule (SG) formation was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that the viral proteins NS3 and NS4A are linked to translational repression, whereas expression of the capsid protein, NS3/NS2B-3, and NS4A interfered with SG formation. Some, but not all, flavivirus capsid proteins also blocked SG assembly, indicating differential interactions between flaviviruses and SG biogenesis pathways. Depletion of the SG components G3BP1, TIAR, and Caprin-1, but not TIA-1, reduced ZIKV replication. Both G3BP1 and Caprin-1 formed complexes with capsid, whereas viral genomic RNA stably interacted with G3BP1 during ZIKV infection. Taken together, these results are consistent with a scenario in which ZIKV uses multiple viral components to hijack key SG proteins to benefit viral replication.
   IMPORTANCE There is a pressing need to understand ZIKV pathogenesis in order to advance the development of vaccines and therapeutics. The cellular stress response constitutes one of the first lines of defense against viral infection; therefore, understanding how ZIKV evades this antiviral system will provide key insights into ZIKV biology and potentially pathogenesis. Here, we show that ZIKV induces the stress response through activation of the UPR (unfolded protein response) and PKR (protein kinase R), leading to host translational arrest, a process likely mediated by the viral proteins NS3 and NS4A. Despite the activation of translational shutoff, formation of SG is strongly inhibited by the virus. Specifically, ZIKV hijacks the core SG proteins G3BP1, TIAR, and Caprin-1 to facilitate viral replication, resulting in impaired SG assembly. This process is potentially facilitated by the interactions of the viral RNA with G3BP1 as well as the viral capsid protein with G3BP1 and Caprin-1. Interestingly, expression of capsid proteins from several other flaviviruses also inhibited SG formation. Taken together, the present study provides novel insights into how ZIKV modulates cellular stress response pathways during replication.

AB The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope spike (Env) mediates viral entry into host cells. The V3 loop of the gp120 component of the Env trimer contributes to the coreceptor binding site and is a target for neutralizing antibodies. We used cryo-electron tomography to visualize the binding of CD4 and the V3 loop monoclonal antibody (MAb) 36D5 to gp120 of the SIV Env trimer. Our results show that 36D5 binds gp120 at the base of the V3 loop and suggest that the antibody exerts its neutralization effect by blocking the coreceptor binding site. The antibody does this without altering the dynamics of the spike motion between closed and open states when CD4 is bound. The interaction between 36D5 and SIV gp120 is similar to the interaction between some broadly neutralizing anti-V3 loop antibodies and HIV-1 gp120. Two conformations of gp120 bound with CD4 are revealed, suggesting an intrinsic dynamic nature of the liganded Env trimer. CD4 binding substantially increases the binding of 36D5 to gp120 in the intact Env trimer, consistent with CD4-induced changes in the conformation of gp120 and the antibody binding site. Binding by MAb 36D5 does not substantially alter the proportions of the two CD4-bound conformations. The position of MAb 36D5 at the V3 base changes little between conformations, indicating that the V3 base serves as a pivot point during the transition between these two states.
   IMPORTANCE Glycoprotein spikes on the surfaces of SIV and HIV are the sole targets available to the immune system for antibody neutralization. Spikes evade the immune system by a combination of a thick layer of polysaccharide on the surface (the glycan shield) and movement between spike domains that masks the epitope conformation. Using SIV virions whose spikes were "decorated" with the primary cellular receptor (CD4) and an antibody (36D5) at part of the coreceptor binding site, we visualized multiple conformations trapped by the rapid freezing step, which were separated using statistical analysis. Our results show that the CD4-induced conformational dynamics of the spike enhances binding of the antibody.

TI Gender Parity Trends for Invited Speakers at Four Prominent Virology

AB Scientific conferences are most beneficial to participants when they showcase significant new experimental developments, accurately summarize the current state of the field, and provide strong opportunities for collaborative networking. A top-notch slate of invited speakers, assembled by conference organizers or committees, is key to achieving these goals. The perceived underrepresentation of female speakers at prominent scientific meetings is currently a popular topic for discussion, but one that often lacks supportive data. We compiled the full rosters of invited speakers over the last 35 years for four prominent international virology conferences, the American Society for Virology Annual Meeting (ASV), the International Herpesvirus Workshop (IHW), the Positive-Strand RNA Virus Symposium (PSR), and the Gordon Research Conference on Viruses & Cells (GRC). The rosters were cross-indexed by unique names, gender, year, and repeat invitations. When plotted as gender-dependent trends over time, all four conferences showed a clear proclivity for male-dominated invited speaker lists. Encouragingly, shifts toward parity are emerging within all units, but at different rates. Not surprisingly, both selection of a larger percentage of first-time participants and the presence of a woman on the speaker selection committee correlated with improved parity. Session chair information was also collected for the IHW and GRC. These visible positions also displayed a strong male dominance over time that is eroding slowly. We offer our personal interpretation of these data to aid future organizers achieve improved equity among the limited number of available positions for session moderators and invited speakers.

AB Group B coxsackieviruses are responsible for chronic cardiac infections. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the virus can persist in the human heart long after the signs of acute myocarditis have abated are still not completely understood. Recently, coxsackievirus B3 strains with 5'-terminal deletions in genomic RNAs were isolated from a patient suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that such mutant viruses may be the forms responsible for persistent infection. These deletions lacked portions of 5' stem-loop I, which is an RNA secondary structure required for viral RNA replication. In this study, we assessed the consequences of the genomic deletions observed in vivo for coxsackievirus B3 biology. Using cell extracts from HeLa cells, as well as transfection of luciferase replicons in two types of cardiomyocytes, we demonstrated that coxsackievirus RNAs harboring 5' deletions ranging from 7 to 49 nucleotides in length can be translated nearly as efficiently as those of wild-type virus. However, these 5' deletions greatly reduced the synthesis of viral RNA in vitro, which was detected only for the 7- and 21-nucleotide deletions. Since 5' stem-loop I RNA forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with cellular and viral proteins involved in viral RNA replication, we investigated the binding of the host cell protein PCBP2, as well as viral protein 3CD(pro), to deleted positive-strand RNAs corresponding to the 5' end. We found that binding of these proteins was conserved but that ribonucleoprotein complex formation required higher PCBP2 and 3CDpro concentrations, depending on the size of the deletion. Overall, this study confirmed the characteristics of persistent CVB3 infection observed in heart tissues and provided a possible explanation for the low level of RNA replication observed for the 5'-deleted viral genomes-a less stable ribonucleoprotein complex formed with proteins involved in viral RNA replication.
   IMPORTANCE Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common indication for heart transplantation worldwide, and coxsackie B viruses are detected in about one-third of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies. Terminal deletions at the 5' end of the viral genome involving an RNA secondary structure required for RNA replication have been recently reported as a possible mechanism of virus persistence in the human heart. These mutations are likely to disrupt the correct folding of an RNA secondary structure required for viral RNA replication. In this report, we demonstrate that transfected RNAs harboring 5'-terminal sequence deletions are able to direct the synthesis of viral proteins, but not genomic RNAs, in human and murine cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we show that the binding of cellular and viral replication factors to viral RNA is conserved despite genomic deletions but that the impaired RNA synthesis as- sociated with terminally deleted viruses could be due to destabilization of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed.

AB Marburg virus (MARV) encodes a nucleoprotein (NP) to encapsidate its genome by oligomerization and form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). According to previous investigation on nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses (nsNSV), the newly synthesized NPs must be prevented from indiscriminately binding to noncognate RNAs. During the viral RNA synthesis process, the RNPs undergo a transition from an RNA-bound form to a template-free form, to open access for the interaction between the viral polymerase and the RNA template. In filoviruses, this transition is regulated by VP35 peptide and other viral components. To further understand the dynamic process of filovirus RNP formation, we report here the structure of MARV NPcore, both in the apo form and in the VP35 peptide-chaperoned form. These structures reveal a typical bilobed structure, with a positive-charged RNA binding groove between two lobes. In the apo form, the MARV NP exists in an interesting hexameric state formed by the hydrophobic interaction within the long helix of the NPcore C-terminal region, which shows high structural flexibility among filoviruses and may imply critical function during RNP formation. Moreover, the VP35 peptide-chaperoned NPcore remains in a monomeric state and completely loses its affinity for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The structural comparison reveals that the RNA binding groove undergoes a transition from closed state to open state, chaperoned by VP35 peptide, thus preventing the interaction for viral RNA. Our investigation provides considerable structural insight into the filovirus RNP working mechanism and may support the development of antiviral therapies targeting the RNP formation of filovirus.
   IMPORTANCE Marburg virus is one of the most dangerous viruses, with high morbidity and mortality. A recent outbreak in Angola in 2005 caused the deaths of 272 persons. NP is one of the most essential proteins, as it encapsidates and protects the whole virus genome simultaneously with self-assembly oligomerization. Here we report the structures of MARV NPcore in two different forms. In the MARV NP apo form, we identify an interesting hexamer formed by hydrophobic interaction within a long helix, which is highly conserved and flexible among filoviruses and may indicate its critical function during the virus RNP formation. Moreover, the structural comparison with the NP-VP35 peptide complex reveals a structural transition chaperoned by VP35, in which the RNA binding groove undergoes a transition from closed state to open state. Finally, we discussed the high conservation and critical role of the VP35 binding pocket and its potential use for therapeutic development.

AB Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus must be activated by proteolysis before the virus can become infectious. Previous studies indicated that HA cleavage is driven by membrane-bound or extracellular serine proteases in the respiratory tract. However, there is still uncertainty as to which proteases are critical for activating HAs of seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) in humans. This study focuses on human KLK1 and KLK5, 2 of the 15 serine proteases known as the kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs). We find that their mRNA expression in primary human bronchial cells is stimulated by IAV infection. Both enzymes cleaved recombinant HA from several strains of the H1 and/or H3 virus subtype in vitro, but only KLK5 promoted the infectivity of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Scotland/20/74 (H3N2) virions in MDCK cells. We assessed the ability of treated viruses to initiate influenza in mice. The nasal instillation of only the KLK5-treated virus resulted in weight loss and lethal outcomes. The secretion of this protease in the human lower respiratory tract is enhanced during influenza. Moreover, we show that pretreatment of airway secretions with a KLK5-selective inhibitor significantly reduced the activation of influenza A/Scotland/20/74 virions, providing further evidence of its importance. Differently, increased KLK1 secretion appeared to be associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cells in human airways regardless of the origin of inflammation. Thus, our findings point to the involvement of KLK5 in the proteolytic activation and spread of seasonal influenza viruses in humans.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause acute infection of the respiratory tract that affects millions of people during seasonal outbreaks every year. Cleavage of the hemagglutinin precursor by host proteases is a critical step in the life cycle of these viruses. Consequently, host proteases that activate HA can be considered promising targets for the development of new antivirals. However, the specific proteases that activate seasonal influenza viruses, especially H3N2 viruses, in the human respiratory tract have remain undefined despite many years of work. Here we demonstrate that the secreted, extracellular protease KLK5 (kallikrein-related peptidase 5) is efficient in promoting the infectivity of H3N2 IAV in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that its secretion was selectively enhanced in the human lower respiratory tract during a seasonal outbreak dominated by an H3N2 virus. Collectively, our data support the clinical relevance of this protease in human influenza pathogenesis.

AB AIDS-related lymphomas (ARLs) are expected to increase in the future since combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) enhances the life expectancy of HIV-1-infected (HIV+) patients but does not affect the occurrence of ARLs to the same extent as that of other tumors. Lymphangiogenesis is essential in supporting growth and metastatic spreading of ARLs. HIV-1 does not infect the neoplastic B cells, but HIV-1 proteins have been hypothesized to play a key role in sustaining a prolymphangiogenic microenvironment in lymphoid organs. The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is detected in blood and accumulates in the germinal centers of lymph nodes of HIV+ patients under successful cART. The viral protein displays potent lymphangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. This is, at least in part, mediated by the secretion of the lymphangiogenic factor endothelin-1, suggesting that activation of a secretory pathway sustains the lymphangiogenic activity of p17. Here, we show that the p17 lymphangiogenic activity occurs on human lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cells (LN-LECs) under stress conditions only and relies entirely on activation of an autophagy-based pathway. In fact, induction of autophagy by p17 promotes lymphangiogenesis, whereas pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy inhibits p17-triggered lymphangiogenesis. Similarly, the vasculogenic activity of p17 was totally inhibited in autophagy-incompetent mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of autophagy in lymphangiogenesis and open the way to identify novel treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting aberrant tumordriven lymphangiogenesis in HIV+ patients.
   IMPORTANCE AIDS-related lymphomas (ARLs) are the most common malignancies in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) patients after the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Lymphangiogenesis is of critical importance in sustaining growth and metastasis of ARLs. Indeed, enhanced lymphangiogenesis occurs in the lymph nodes of HIV+ patients under successful cART. The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is detected in blood and accumulates in the lymph node germinal centers even in the absence of virus replication. Several findings suggest a key role for p17 as a microenvironmental factor capable of promoting lymphangiogenesis. Here, we show that p17 promotes lymphangiogenesis of human lymph node-derived lymphatic endothelial cells (LN-LECs). The lymphangiogenic activity of p17 is sustained by an autophagy-based pathway that enables LN-LECs to release prolymphangiogenic factors into the extracellular microenvironment. Our findings indicate that specific targeting of autophagy may provide an important new tool for treating ARLs.

AB Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is dependent on the release of infectious virus particles into the virological synapse. The HTLV-1 particle structure is still poorly understood, and previous studies analyzed viruses produced by transformed lymphocytic cell lines chronically infected with HTLV-1, particularly the MT-2 cell line, which harbors truncated proviruses and expresses aberrant forms of the Gag protein. In this study, we demonstrate that the chronically infected SP cell line harbors a relatively low number of proviruses, making it a more promising experimental system for the study of the HTLV-1 particle structure. We first identified the genomic sites of integration and characterized the genetic structure of the gag region in each provirus. We also determined that despite encoding a truncated Gag protein, only the full-length Gag protein was incorporated into virus particles. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy analyses of the purified virus particles revealed three classes of particles based upon capsid core morphology: complete cores, incomplete cores, and particles without distinct electron densities that would correlate with the capsid region of a core structure. Observed cores were generally polygonal, and virus particles were on average 115 nm in diameter. These data corroborate particle morphologies previously observed for MT-2 cells and provide evidence that the known poor infectivity of HTLV-1 particles may correlate with HTLV-1 particle populations containing few virus particles possessing a complete capsid core structure.
   IMPORTANCE Studies of retroviral particle core morphology have demonstrated a correlation between capsid core stability and the relative infectivity of the virus. In this study, we used cryo-transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate that HTLV-1 particles produced from a distinct chronically infected cell line are polymorphic in nature, with many particles lacking organized electron densities that would correlate with a complete core structure. These findings have important implications for infectious HTLV-1 spread, particularly in the context of cell-to-cell transmission, a critical step in HTLV-1 transmission and pathogenesis.

AB The SAT protein (SATp) of porcine parvovirus (PPV) accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and SAT deletion induces the slow-spreading phenotype. The in vitro comparison of the wild-type Kresse strain and its SAT knockout (SAT(-)) mutant revealed that prolonged cell integrity and late viral release are responsible for the slower spreading of the SAT(-) virus. During PPV infection, regardless of the presence or absence of SATp, the expression of downstream ER stress response proteins (Xbp1 and CHOP) was induced. However, in the absence of SATp, significant differences in the quantity and the localization of CHOP were detected, suggesting a role of SATp in the induction of irreversible ER stress in infected cells. The involvement of the induction of irreversible ER stress in porcine testis (PT) cell necrosis and viral egress was confirmed by treatment of infected cells by ER stress-inducing chemicals (MG132, dithiothreitol, and thapsigargin), which accelerated the egress and spreading of both the wild-type and the SAT(-) viruses. UV stress induction had no beneficial effect on PPV infection, underscoring the specificity of ER stress pathways in the process. However, induction of CHOP and its nuclear translocation cannot alone be responsible for the biological effect of SAT, since nuclear CHOP could not complement the lack of SAT in a coexpression experiment.

AB Immunotherapy with passive administration of broadly neutralizing HIV-1 envelope-specific antibodies (bnAbs) in the setting of established infection in vivo has yielded mixed results. The contribution of different antibodies toward the direct elimination of infected cells is poorly understood. In this study, we determined the ability of 12 well-characterized anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies to recognize and eliminate primary CD4 T cells infected with HIV-1 belonging to clades A, B, C, and D, via antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in vitro. We further tested unique combinations of these antibodies to determine the optimal antibody cocktails to be tested in future clinical trials. We report that antibody binding to infected CD4 T cells is highly variable and correlates with ADCML and ADCC processes. Particularly, antibodies targeting the envelope glycan shield (2G12) and V1/V2 site (PG9, PG16, and PGT145) are best at recognizing HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells. However, only PG9 and PG16 and their combinations with other bnAbs sufficiently induced the elimination of HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells by ADCML, ADCC, or both. Notably, CD4 binding site antibodies VRC01, 3BNC117, and NIH45-46 G54W did not exhibit recognition of infected cells and were unable to induce their killing. Future trials geared toward the development of a cure for HIV/AIDS should incorporate V1/V2 antibodies for maximal clearance of infected cells. With the use of only primary immune cells, we conducted a comprehensive cross-clade physiological analysis to aid the direction of antibodies as therapeutics toward the development of a cure for HIV/AIDS.
   IMPORTANCE Several antibodies capable of neutralizing the majority of circulating HIV-1 strains have been identified to date and have been shown to prevent infection in animal models. However, the use of combinations of such broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) for the treatment and eradication of HIV-1 in infected humans remains uncertain. In this study, we tested the ability of bnAbs to directly recognize and eliminate primary human CD4 T cells infected with diverse HIV-1 strains representative of the global epidemic by antibody-dependent pathways. We also tested several combinations of bnAbs in our assays in order to maximize the clearance of infected cells. We show that the ability of bnAbs to identify and kill infected cells is highly variable and that only a few of them are able to exert this function. Our data will help guide the formulation of bnAbs to test in future human trials aimed at the development of a cure.

AB Intact and broad immune cell effector functions and specific individual cytokines have been linked to HIV disease outcome, but their relative contribution to HIV control remains unclear. We asked whether the proteome of secreted cytokines and signaling factors in peripheral blood can be used to discover specific pathways critical for host viral control. A custom glass-based microarray, able to measure >600 plasma proteins involved in cell-to-cell communication, was used to measure plasma protein profiles in 96 HIV-infected, treatment-naive individuals with high (> 50,000) or low (<10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml) viral loads. Univariate and regression model analysis demonstrate that plasma levels of soluble interleukin-27 (IL-27) are significantly elevated in individuals with high plasma viremia (P < 0.0001) and are positively correlated with proviral HIV-DNA copy numbers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Rho = 0.4011; P = 0.0027). Moreover, soluble IL-27 plasma levels are negatively associated with the breadth and magnitude of the total virus-specific T-cell responses and directly with plasma levels of molecules involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In addition to IL-27, gene expression levels of the specific IL-27 receptor (IL27RA) in PBMC correlated directly with both plasma viral load (Rho = 0.3531; P = 0.0218) and the proviral copy number in the peripheral blood as an indirect measure of partial viral reservoir (Rho = 0.4580; P = 0.0030). These results were validated in unrelated cohorts of early infected subjects as well as subjects before and after initiation of antiretroviral treatment, and they identify IL-27 and its specific receptor as a critical immune axis for the antiviral immune response and as robust correlates of viral load and proviral reservoir size in PBMC.
   IMPORTANCE The detailed knowledge of immune mechanisms that contribute to HIV control is a prerequisite for the design of effective treatment strategies to achieve HIV cure. Cells communicate with each other by secreting signaling proteins, and the blood is a key conduit for transporting such factors. Investigating the communication factors promoting effective immune responses and having potentially antiviral functions against HIV using a novel focused omics approach ("communicome") has the potential to significantly improve our knowledge of effective host immunity and accelerate the HIV cure agenda. Including 140 subjects with variable viral loads and measuring the plasma levels of >600 soluble proteins, our data highlight the importance of Th17 cells and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in HIV control and especially identify the IL-27/IL-27 receptor subunit alpha (IL-27RA) axis as a predictor of plasma viral load and proviral copy number in the peripheral blood. These data may provide important guidance to therapeutic approaches in the HIV cure agenda.

AB Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, with virtually all cases of cervical cancer being attributable to infection by oncogenic HPVs. However, the exact mechanism and receptors used by HPV to infect epithelial cells are controversial. The current entry model suggests that HPV initially attaches to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the cell surface, followed by conformational changes, cleavage by furin convertase, and subsequent transfer of the virus to an as-yet-unidentified high-affinity receptor. In line with this model, we established an in vitro infection system using the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677 together with HPV16 pseudovirions (HPV16-PsVs). While pgsD677 cells were nonpermissive for untreated HPV16-PsVs, furin cleavage of the particles led to a substantial increase in infection. Biochemical pulldown assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that furin-precleaved HPV16-PsVs specifically interacted with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677 cells. We further demonstrated that both furin-precleaved and uncleaved HPV16-PsVs colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells, while binding of incoming viral particles to soluble vimentin protein before infection led to a substantial decrease in viral uptake. Interestingly, decreasing cell surface vimentin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in HeLa and NIKS cells significantly increased HPV16-PsV infectious internalization, while overexpression of vimentin had the opposite effect. The identification of vimentin as an HPV restriction factor enhances our understanding of the initial steps of HPV-host interaction and may lay the basis for the design of novel antiviral drugs preventing HPV internalization into epithelial cells.
   IMPORTANCE Despite HPV being a highly prevalent sexually transmitted virus causing significant disease burden worldwide, particularly cancer of the cervix, cell surface events preceding oncogenic HPV internalization are poorly understood. We herein describe the identification of surface-expressed vimentin as a novel molecule not previously implicated in the infectious internalization of HPV16. Contrary to our expectations, vimentin was found to act not as a receptor but rather as a restriction factor dampening the initial steps of HPV16 infection. These results importantly contribute to our current understanding of the molecular events during the infectious internalization of HPV16 and open a new direction in the development of alternative drugs to prevent HPV infection.

AB In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which human choline kinase-alpha (hCK alpha) interacts with nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII alpha), the lipid kinase crucial for maintaining the integrity of virus-induced membranous webs, and modulates hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. hCK alpha activity positively modulated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) levels in HCV-expressing cells, and hCK alpha -mediated PI4P accumulation was abolished by AL-9, a PI4KIII alpha specific inhibitor. hCK alpha colocalized with NS5A and PI4KIII alpha or PI4P; NS5A expression increased hCK alpha and PI4KIII alpha colocalization; and hCK alpha formed a ternary complex with PI4KIII alpha and NS5A, supporting the functional interplay of hCK alpha with PI4KIII alpha and NS5A. PI4KIII alpha inactivation by AL-9 or hCK alpha inactivation by CK37, a specific hCK alpha inhibitor, impaired the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization and colocalization of these three molecules. Interestingly, hCK alpha knockdown or inactivation inhibited PI4KIII alpha NS5A binding. In an in vitro PI4KIII alpha activity assay, hCK alpha activity slightly increased PI4KIII alpha basal activity but greatly augmented NS5A-induced PI4KIII alpha activity, supporting the essential role of ternary complex formation in robust PI4KIII alpha activation. Concurring with the upregulation of PI4P production and viral replication, overexpression of active hCK alpha-R (but not the D288A mutant) restored PI4KIII alpha and NS5A translocation to the ER in hCK alpha stable knockdown cells. Furthermore, active PI4KIII alpha overexpression restored PI4P production, PI4KIII alpha and NS5A translocation to the ER, and viral replication in CK37-treated cells. Based on our results, hCK alpha functions as an indispensable regulator that bridges PI4KIII alpha and NS5A and potentiates NS5Astimulated PI4KIII alpha activity, which then facilitates the targeting of the ternary complex to the ER for viral replication.
   IMPORTANCE The mechanisms by which hCK alpha activity modulates the transport of the hCK alpha-NS5A complex to the ER are not understood. In the present study, we investigated how hCK alpha interacts with PI4KIII alpha (a key element that maintains the integrity of the "membranous web" structure) and NS5A to regulate viral replication. We demonstrated that HCV hijacks hCK alpha to bridge PI4KIII alpha and NS5A, forming a ternary complex, which then stimulates PI4KIII alpha activity to produce PI4P. Pronounced PI4P synthesis then redirects the translocation of the ternary complex to the ER-derived, PI4P-enriched membrane for assembly of the viral replication complex and viral replication. Our study provides novel insights into the indispensable modulatory role of hCK alpha in the recruitment of PI4KIII alpha to NS5A and in NS5A-stimulated PI4P production and reveals a new perspective for understanding the impact of profound PI4KIII alpha activation on the targeting of PI4KIII alpha and NS5A to the PI4P-enriched membrane for viral replication complex formation.

AB Phosphorylation of the beta C1 protein encoded by the betasatellite of tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNB-beta C1) by SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) plays a critical role in defense of host plants against geminivirus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. However, how phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 impacts its pathogenic functions during viral infection remains elusive. In this study, we identified two additional tyrosine residues in TYLCCNB-beta C1 that are phosphorylated by SnRK1. The effects of TYLCCNB-beta C1 phosphorylation on its functions as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) and a symptom determinant were investigated via phosphorylation mimic mutants in N. benthamiana plants. Mutations that mimic phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 at tyrosine 5 and tyrosine 110 attenuated disease symptoms during viral infection. The phosphorylation mimics weakened the ability of TYLCCNB-beta C1 to reverse transcriptional gene silencing and to suppress posttranscriptional gene silencing and abolished its interaction with N. benthamiana ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 in N. benthamiana leaves. The mimic phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 had no impact on its protein stability, subcellular localization, or self-association. Our data establish an inhibitory effect of phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 on its pathogenic functions as a VSR and a symptom determinant and provide a mechanistic explanation of how SnRK1 functions as a host defense factor.
   IMPORTANCE Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV), which causes a severe yellow leaf curl disease in China, is a monopartite geminivirus associated with the betasatellite (TYLCCNB). TYLCCNB encodes a single pathogenicity protein, beta C1 (TYLCCNB-beta C1), which functions as both a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) and a symptom determinant. Here, we show that mimicking phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 weakens its ability to reverse transcriptional gene silencing, to suppress posttranscriptional gene silencing, and to interact with N. benthamiana ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1. To our knowledge, this is the first report establishing an inhibitory effect of phosphorylation of TYLCCNB-beta C1 on its pathogenic functions as both a VSR and a symptom determinant and to provide a mechanistic explanation of how SNF1-related protein kinase 1 acts as a host defense factor. These findings expand the scope of phosphorylation-mediated defense mechanisms and contribute to further understanding of plant defense mechanisms against geminiviruses.

AB Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a typical gammaherpesvirus that establishes persistent lifelong infection in host cells. In order to establish successful infection, KSHV has evolved numerous immune evasion strategies to bypass or hijack the host immune system. However, host cells still produce immune cytokines abundantly during primary KSHV infection. Whether the immune effectors produced are able to inhibit viral infection and how KSHV successfully conquers these immune effectors remain largely unknown. The guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) gene is an interferon-stimulated gene and exerts antiviral functions on several RNA viruses; however, its function in DNA virus infection is less well understood. In this study, we found that KSHV infection increases both the transcriptional and protein levels of GBP1 at the early stage of primary infection by activating the NF-kappa B pathway. The overexpression of GBP1 significantly inhibited KSHV infection, while the knockdown of GBP1 promoted KSHV infection. The GTPase activity and dimerization of GBP1 were demonstrated to be responsible for its anti-KSHV activity. Furthermore, we found that GBP1 inhibited the nuclear delivery of KSHV virions by disrupting the formation of actin filaments. Finally, we demonstrated that replication and transcription activator (RTA) promotes the degradation of GBP1 through a proteasome pathway. Taken together, these results provide a new understanding of the antiviral mechanism of GBP1, which possesses potent anti-KSHV activity, and suggest the critical role of RTA in the evasion of the innate immune response during primary infection by KSHV.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has established lifelong infection in more than 90% of humanity. While infection is usually controlled by the immune system, the human host fails to completely eliminate the pathogen. Several herpesviral proteins are known to act as immunoevasins, preventing or reducing recognition of EBV-infected cells. Only recently were microRNAs of EBV identified to reduce immune recognition further. This Gem summarizes what we know about immunomodulatory microRNAs of herpesviruses.

AB We have demonstrated that a liposomal array of well-ordered trimers enhances B cell activation, germinal center formation, and the elicitation of tier-2 autologous neutralizing antibodies. Previously, we coupled well-ordered cleavage-independent NFL trimers via their C-terminal polyhistidine tails to nickel lipids integrated into the lipid bilayer. Despite favorable in vivo effects, concern remained over the potentially longer-term in vivo instability of noncovalent linkage of the trimers to the liposomes. Accordingly, we tested both cobalt coupling and covalent linkage of the trimers to the liposomes by reengineering the polyhistidine tail to include a free cysteine on each protomer of model BG505 NFL trimers to allow covalent linkage. Both cobalt and cysteine coupling resulted in a high-density array of NFL trimers that was stable in both 20% mouse serum and 100 mM EDTA, whereas the nickel-conjugated trimers were not stable under these conditions. Binding analysis and calcium flux with anti-Env-specific B cells confirmed that the trimers maintained conformational integrity following coupling. Following immunization of mice, serologic analysis demonstrated that the covalently coupled trimers elicited Env-directed antibodies in a manner statistically significantly improved compared to soluble trimers and nickel-conjugated trimers. Importantly, the covalent coupling not only enhanced gp120-directed responses compared to soluble trimers, it also completely eliminated antibodies directed to the C-terminal His tag located at the "bottom" of the spike. In contrast, soluble and noncovalent formats efficiently elicited anti-His tag antibodies. These data indicate that covalent linkage of well-ordered trimers to liposomes in high-density array displays multiple advantages in vitro and in vivo.
   IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses typically encode a surface-bound glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into host cells and is a primary target for vaccine design. Liposomes with modified lipid head groups have a unique feature of capturing and displaying antigens on their surfaces, mimicking the native pathogens. Our first-generation nickel-based liposomes captured HIV-1 Env glycoprotein trimers via a noncovalent linkage with improved efficacy over soluble glycoprotein in activating germinal center B cells and eliciting tier-2 autologous neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we report the development of second-generation cobalt- and maleimide-based liposomes that have improved in vitro stability over nickel-based liposomes. In particular, the maleimide liposomes captured HIV-1 Env trimers via a more stable covalent bond, resulting in enhanced germinal center B cell responses that generated higher antibody titers than the soluble trimers and liposome-bearing trimers via noncovalent linkages. We further demonstrate that covalent coupling prevents release of the trimers prior to recognition by B cells and masks a nonneutralizing determinant located at the bottom of the trimer.

   PATHOGENESIS
AB In December 2016, a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N2) virus was identified to be the causative source of an outbreak in a cat shelter in New York City, which subsequently spread to multiple shelters in the states of New York and Pennsylvania. One person with occupational exposure to infected cats became infected with the virus, representing the first LPAI H7N2 virus infection in a human in North America since 2003. Considering the close contact that frequently occurs between companion animals and humans, it was critical to assess the relative risk of this novel virus to public health. The virus isolated from the human case, A/New York/108/2016 (NY/108), caused mild and transient illness in ferrets and mice but did not transmit to naive cohoused ferrets following traditional or aerosol-based inoculation methods. The environmental persistence of NY/108 virus was generally comparable to that of other LPAI H7N2 viruses. However, NY/108 virus replicated in human bronchial epithelial cells with an increased efficiency compared with that of previously isolated H7N2 viruses. Furthermore, the novel H7N2 virus was found to utilize a relatively lower pH for hemagglutinin activation, similar to human influenza viruses. Our data suggest that the LPAI H7N2 virus requires further adaptation before representing a substantial threat to public health. However, the reemergence of an LPAI H7N2 virus in the northeastern United States underscores the need for continuous surveillance of emerging zoonotic influenza viruses inclusive of mammalian species, such as domestic felines, that are not commonly considered intermediate hosts for avian influenza viruses.
   IMPORTANCE Avian influenza viruses are capable of crossing the species barrier to infect mammals, an event of public health concern due to the potential acquisition of a pandemic phenotype. In December 2016, an H7N2 virus caused an outbreak in cats in multiple animal shelters in New York State. This was the first detection of this virus in the northeastern United States in over a decade and the first documented infection of a felid with an H7N2 virus. A veterinarian became infected following occupational exposure to H7N2 virus-infected cats, necessitating the evaluation of this virus for its capacity to cause disease in mammals. While the H7N2 virus was associated with mild illness in mice and ferrets and did not spread well between ferrets, it nonetheless possessed several markers of virulence for mammals. These data highlight the promiscuity of influenza viruses and the need for diligent surveillance across multiple species to quickly identify an emerging strain with pandemic potential.

TI Molluscum Contagiosum Virus MC159 Abrogates cIAP1-NEMO Interactions and

AB Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a dermatotropic poxvirus that causes benign skin lesions. MCV lesions persist because of virally encoded immune evasion molecules that inhibit antiviral responses. The MCV MC159 protein suppresses NF-kappa B activation, a powerful antiviral response, via interactions with the NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) subunit of the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex. Binding of MC159 to NEMO does not disrupt the IKK complex, implying that MC159 prevents IKK activation via an as-yet-unidentified strategy. Here, we demonstrated that MC159 inhibited NEMO polyubiquitination, a posttranslational modification required for IKK and downstream NF-kappa B activation. Because MCV cannot be propagated in cell culture, MC159 was expressed independent of infection or during a surrogate vaccinia virus infection to identify how MC159 prevented polyubiquitination. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) is a cellular E3 ligase that ubiquitinates NEMO. Mutational analyses revealed that MC159 and cIAP1 each bind to the same NEMO region, suggesting that MC159 may competitively inhibit cIAP1-NEMO interactions. Indeed, MC159 prevented cIAP1-NEMO interactions. MC159 also diminished cIAP1-mediated NEMO polyubiquitination and cIAP1-induced NF-kappa B activation. These data suggest that MC159 competitively binds to NEMO to prevent cIAP1-induced NEMO polyubiquitination. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a viral protein disrupting NEMO-cIAP1 interactions to strategically suppress IKK activation. All viruses must antagonize antiviral signaling events for survival. We hypothesize that MC159 inhibits NEMO polyubiquitination as a clever strategy to manipulate the host cell environment to the benefit of the virus.
   IMPORTANCE Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a human-specific poxvirus that causes persistent skin neoplasms. The persistence of MCV has been attributed to viral downregulation of host cell immune responses such as NF-kappa B activation. We show here that the MCV MC159 protein interacts with the NEMO subunit of the IKK complex to prevent NEMO interactions with the cIAP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction correlates with a dampening of cIAP1 to polyubiquitinate NEMO and to activate NF-kappa B. This inhibition of cIAP1-NEMO interactions is a new viral strategy to minimize IKK activation and to control NEMO polyubiquitination. This research provides new insights into mechanisms that persistent viruses may use to cause long-term infection of host cells.

AB We have developed pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines (pLAIVs) against clade 1 H5N1 viruses on an Ann Arbor cold-adapted (ca) backbone that induced long-term immune memory. In 2015, many human infections caused by a new clade (clade 2.2.1.1) of goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage H5N1 viruses were reported in Egypt, which prompted updating of the H5N1 pLAIV. We explored two strategies to generate suitable pLAIVs. The first approach was to modify the hemagglutinin gene of a highly pathogenic wild-type (wt) clade 2.2.1.1 virus, A/Egypt/N03434/2009 (Egy/09) (H5N1), with its unmodified neuraminidase (NA) gene; this virus was designated Egy/09 ca. The second approach was to select a low-pathogenicity avian influenza H5 virus that elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with a broad range of H5 viruses, including the Egypt H5N1 viruses, and contained a novel NA subtype for humans. We selected the low-pathogenicity A/duck/Hokkaido/69/2000 (H5N3) (dk/Hok/00) virus for this purpose. Both candidate vaccines were attenuated and immunogenic in ferrets, inducing antibodies that neutralized homologous and heterologous H5 viruses with different degrees of cross-reactivity; Egy/09 ca vaccine antisera were more specific for the gs/GD lineage viruses but did not neutralize recent North American isolates (clade 2.3.4.4), whereas antisera from dk/Hok/69 ca-vaccinated ferrets cross-reacted with clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.2.1 viruses but not clade 1 or 2.1 viruses. When vaccinated ferrets were challenged with homologous and heterologous H5 viruses, challenge virus replication was reduced in the respiratory tract. Thus, the two H5 pLAIV candidates are suitable for clinical development to protect humans from infection with different clades of H5 viruses.
   IMPORTANCE In response to the continuing evolution of H5N1 avian influenza viruses and human infections, new candidate H5 live attenuated vaccines were developed by using two different approaches: one targeted a specific circulating strain in Egypt, and the other was based on a virus that elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies against a wide range of H5 viruses. Both candidate vaccines were immunogenic and exhibited protective efficacy in ferrets. Our study permits a comparison of the two approaches, and the data support the further development of both vaccine viruses to optimally prepare for the further spread of clade 2.2.1 or 2.3.4.4 viruses.

   PATHWAY
AB Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), the only known extant human-adapted poxvirus, causes a long-duration infection characterized by skin lesions that typically display an absence of inflammation despite containing high titers of live virus. Despite this curious presentation, MCV is very poorly characterized in terms of host-pathogen interactions. The absence of inflammation around MCV lesions suggests the presence of potent inhibitors of human antiviral immunity and inflammation. However, only a small number of MCV immunomodulatory genes have been characterized in detail. It is likely that many more remain to be discovered, given the density of such sequences in other poxvirus genomes. NF-kappa B activation occurs in response to both virus-induced pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling and cellular activation by virus-induced proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1. Activated NF-kappa B drives cytokine and interferon gene expression, leading to inflammation and virus clearance. We report that MC005, which has no orthologs in other poxvirus genomes, is a novel inhibitor of PRR- and cytokine-stimulated NF-kappa B activation. MC005 inhibited NF-kappa B proximal to the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, and unbiased affinity purification revealed that MC005 interacts with the IKK subunit NEMO (NF-kappa B essential modulator). MC005 binding to NEMO prevents the conformational priming of the IKK complex that occurs when NEMO binds to ubiquitin chains during pathway activation. These data reveal a novel mechanism of poxvirus inhibition of human innate immunity, validate current dynamic models of NEMO-dependent IKK complex activation, and further clarify how the human-adapted poxvirus MCV can so effectively evade antiviral immunity and suppress inflammation to persist in human skin lesions.
   IMPORTANCE Poxviruses adapt to specific hosts over time, evolving and tailoring elegantly precise inhibitors of the rate-limiting steps within the signaling pathways that control innate immunity and inflammation. These inhibitors reveal new features of the antiviral response, clarify existing models of signaling regulation while offering potent new tools for approaching therapeutic intervention in autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is the only known extant poxvirus specifically adapted to human infection and appears adept at evading normal human antiviral responses, yet it remains poorly characterized. We report the identification of MCV protein MC005 as an inhibitor of the pathways leading to the activation of NF-kappa B, an essential regulator of innate immunity. Further, identification of the mechanism of inhibition of NF-kappa B by MC005 confirms current models of the complex way in which NF-kappa B is regulated and greatly expands our understanding of how MCV so effectively evades human immunity.

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common viral infection acquired by the developing human fetus and can result in damage to the developing central nervous system. Although vaccine development to modify this congenital infection is ongoing, the unique epidemiology of maternal HCMV infections appears discordant with strategies for vaccine development. Several characteristics of congenital HCMV infections suggest that the efficacy of vaccines designed to induce responses similar to those that follow natural infection will be limited.

   REPLICATION
AB Rta, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early protein, reactivates viral lytic replication that is closely associated with tumorigenesis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that in epithelial cells Rta efficiently induced cellular senescence, which is an irreversible G(1) arrest likely to provide a favorable environment for productive replications of EBV and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). To restrict progression of the cell cycle, Rta simultaneously upregulates CDK inhibitors and downregulates MYC, CCND1, and JUN, among others. Rta has long been known as a potent transcriptional activator, thus its role in gene repression is unexpected. In silico analysis revealed that the promoter regions of MYC, CCND1, and JUN are common in (i) the presence of CpG islands, (ii) strong chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signals of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and (iii) having at least one Rta binding site. By combining ChIP assays and DNA methylation analysis, here we provide evidence showing that Rta binding accumulated CpG methylation and decreased CTCF occupancy in the regulatory regions of MYC, CCND1, and JUN, which were associated with downregulated gene expression. Stable residence of CTCF in the viral latency and reactivation control regions is a hallmark of viral latency. Here, we observed that Rta-mediated decreased binding of CTCF in the viral genome is concurrent with virus reactivation. Via interfering with CTCF binding, in the host genome Rta can function as a transcriptional repressor for gene silencing, while in the viral genome Rta acts as an activator for lytic gene loci by removing a topological constraint established by CTCF.
   IMPORTANCE CTCF is a multifunctional protein that variously participates in gene expression and higher-order chromatin structure of the cellular and viral genomes. In certain loci of the genome, CTCF occupancy and DNA methylation are mutually exclusive. Here, we demonstrate that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early protein, Rta, known to be a transcriptional activator, can also function as a transcriptional repressor. Via enriching CpG methylation and decreasing CTCF reloading, Rta binding efficiently shut down the expression of MYC, CCND1, and JUN, thus impeding cell cycle progression. Rta-mediated disruption of CTCF binding was also detected in the latency/reactivation control regions of the EBV genome, and this in turn led to viral lytic cycle progression. As emerging evidence indicates that a methylated EBV genome is a preferable substrate for EBV Zta, the other immediate-early protein, our results suggest a mechanistic link in understanding the molecular processes of viral latent-lytic switch.

AB Viral gene sequences from an enlarged set of about 200 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strains, including many primary isolates, have been used to investigate variation in key viral genetic regions, particularly LMP1, Zp, gp350, EBNA1, and the BART microRNA (miRNA) cluster 2. Determination of type 1 and type 2 EBV in saliva samples from people from a wide range of geographic and ethnic backgrounds demonstrates a small percentage of healthy white Caucasian British people carrying predominantly type 2 EBV. Linkage of Zp and gp350 variants to type 2 EBV is likely to be due to their genes being adjacent to the EBNA3 locus, which is one of the major determinants of the type 1/type 2 distinction. A novel classification of EBNA1 DNA binding domains, named QCIGP, results from phylogeny analysis of their protein sequences but is not linked to the type 1/type 2 classification. The BART cluster 2 miRNA region is classified into three major variants through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the primary miRNA outside the mature miRNA sequences. These SNPs can result in altered levels of expression of some miRNAs from the BART variant frequently present in Chinese and Indonesian nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) samples. The EBV genetic variants identified here provide a basis for future, more directed analysis of association of specific EBV variations with EBV biology and EBV-associated diseases.
   IMPORTANCE Incidence of diseases associated with EBV varies greatly in different parts of the world. Thus, relationships between EBV genome sequence variation and health, disease, geography, and ethnicity of the host may be important for understanding the role of EBV in diseases and for development of an effective EBV vaccine. This paper provides the most comprehensive analysis so far of variation in specific EBV genes relevant to these diseases and proposed EBV vaccines. By focusing on variation in LMP1, Zp, gp350, EBNA1, and the BART miRNA cluster 2, new relationships with the known type 1/type 2 strains are demonstrated, and a novel classification of EBNA1 and the BART miRNAs is proposed.

TI Deletion of the K1L Gene Results in a Vaccinia Virus That Is Less

   Protective Immunity

AB All viruses strategically alter the antiviral immune response to their benefit. The vaccinia virus (VACV) K1 protein has multiple immunomodulatory effects in tissue culture models of infection, including NF-kappa B antagonism. However, the effect of K1 during animal infection is poorly understood. We determined that a K1L-less vaccinia virus (v Delta K1L) was less pathogenic than wild-type VACV in intranasal and intradermal models of infection. Decreased pathogenicity was correlated with diminished virus replication in intranasally infected mice. However, in intradermally inoculated ears, v Delta K1L replicated to levels nearly identical to those of VACV, implying that the decreased immune response to v Delta K1L infection, not virus replication, dictated lesion size. Several lines of evidence support this theory. First, v Delta K1L induced slightly less edema than vK1L, as revealed by histopathology and noninvasive quantitative ultrasound technology (QUS). Second, infiltrating immune cell populations were decreased in v Delta K1L-infected ears. Third, cytokine and chemokine gene expression was decreased in v Delta K1L-infected ears. While these results identified the biological basis for smaller lesions, they remained puzzling; because K1 antagonizes NF-kappa B in vitro, antiviral gene expression was expected to be higher during v Delta K1L infection. Despite these diminished innate immune responses, v Delta K1L vaccination induced a protective VACV-specific CD8(+) T cell response and protected against a lethal VACV challenge. Thus, v Delta K1L is the first vaccinia virus construct reported that caused a muted innate immune gene expression profile and decreased immune cell infiltration in an intradermal model of infection yet still elicited protective immunity.
   IMPORTANCE The vaccinia virus (VACV) K1 protein inhibits NF-kappa B activation among its other antagonistic functions. A virus lacking K1 (v Delta K1L) was predicted to be less pathogenic because it would trigger a more robust antiviral immune response than VACV. Indeed, v Delta K1L was less pathogenic in intradermally infected mouse ear pinnae. However, v Delta K1L infection unexpectedly elicited dramatically reduced infiltration of innate immune cells into ears. This was likely due to decreased expression of cytokine and chemokine genes in v Delta K1L-infected ears. As such, our finding contradicted observations from cell culture systems. Interestingly, v Delta K1L conferred protective immunity against lethal VACV challenge. This suggests that the muted immune response triggered during V Delta K1L infection remained sufficient to mount an effective protective response. Our results highlight the complexity and unpredictable nature of virus-host interactions, a relationship that must be understood to better comprehend virus pathogenesis or to manipulate viruses for use as vaccines.

TI Sensing of HIV-1 Entry Triggers a Type I Interferon Response in Human
   Primary Macrophages

AB Along with CD4(+) T lymphocytes, macrophages are a major cellular source of HIV-1 replication and a potential viral reservoir. Following entry and reverse transcription in macrophages, cloaking of the viral cDNA by the HIV-1 capsid limits its cytosolic detection, enabling efficient replication. However, whether incoming HIV-1 particles are sensed by macrophages prior to reverse transcription remains unclear. Here, we show that HIV-1 triggers a broad expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISG) in monocyte-derived macrophages within a few hours after infection. This response does not require viral reverse transcription or the presence of HIV-1 RNA within particles, but viral fusion is essential. This response is elicited by viruses carrying different envelope proteins and thus different receptors to proceed for viral entry. Expression of ISG in response to viral entry requires TBK1 activity and type I IFNs signaling. Remarkably, the ISG response is transient but affects subsequent viral spread. Together, our results shed light on an early step of HIV-1 sensing by macrophages at the level of entry, which confers an early protection through type I IFN signaling and has potential implications in controlling the infection.
   IMPORTANCE HIV infection is restricted to T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV-1-infected macrophages are found in many tissues of infected patients, even under antiretroviral therapy, and are considered a viral reservoir. How HIV-1 is detected and what type of responses are elicited upon sensing remain in great part elusive. The kinetics and localization of the production of cytokines such as interferons in response to HIV is of critical importance to understanding how the infection and the immune response are established. Our study provides evidence that macrophages can detect HIV-1 as soon as it enters the cell. Interestingly, this sensing is independent of the presence of viral nucleic acids within the particles but requires their fusion with the macrophages. This triggers a low interferon response, which activates an antiviral program protecting cells against further viral challenge and thus potentially limiting the spread of the infection.

AB Most HIV-1 virions contain two copies of full-length viral RNA, indicating that genome packaging is efficient and tightly regulated. However, the structural protein Gag is the only component required for the assembly of noninfectious viruslike particles, and the viral RNA is dispensable in this process. The mechanism that allows HIV-1 to achieve such high efficiency of genome packaging when a packageable viral RNA is not required for virus assembly is currently unknown. In this report, we examined the role of HIV-1 RNA in virus assembly and found that packageable HIV-1 RNA enhances particle production when Gag is expressed at levels similar to those in cells containing one provirus. However, such enhancement is diminished when Gag is overexpressed, suggesting that the effects of viral RNA can be replaced by increased Gag concentration in cells. We also showed that the specific interactions between Gag and viral RNA are required for the enhancement of particle production. Taken together, these studies are consistent with our previous hypothesis that specific dimeric viral RNA-Gag interactions are the nucleation event of infectious virion assembly, ensuring that one RNA dimer is packaged into each nascent virion. These studies shed light on the mechanism by which HIV-1 achieves efficient genome packaging during virus assembly.
   IMPORTANCE Retrovirus assembly is a well-choreographed event, during which many viral and cellular components come together to generate infectious virions. The viral RNA genome carries the genetic information to new host cells, providing instructions to generate new virions, and therefore is essential for virion infectivity. In this report, we show that the specific interaction of the viral RNA genome with the structural protein Gag facilitates virion assembly and particle production. These findings resolve the conundrum that HIV-1 RNA is selectively packaged into virions with high efficiency despite being dispensable for virion assembly. Understanding the mechanism used by HIV-1 to ensure genome packaging provides significant insights into viral assembly and replication.

AB Out of an estimated 31,100 cases since their discovery in 1976, ebolaviruses have caused approximately 13,000 deaths. The vast majority (similar to 11,000) of these occurred during the 2013-2016 West African epidemic. Three out of five species in the genus are known to cause Ebola Virus Disease in humans. Several monoclonal antibodies against the ebolavirus glycoprotein are currently in development as therapeutics. However, there is still a paucity of monoclonal antibodies that can cross-react between the glycoproteins of different ebolavirus species, and the mechanism of these monoclonal antibody therapeutics is still not understood in detail. Here, we generated a panel of eight murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) utilizing a prime-boost vaccination regimen with a Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein expression plasmid followed by infection with a vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. We tested the binding breadth of the resulting monoclonal antibodies using a set of recombinant surface glycoproteins from Reston, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo, Zaire, Sudan, and Marburg viruses and found two antibodies that showed pan-ebolavirus binding. An in vivo Stat2(-/-) mouse model was utilized to test the ability of these MAbs to protect from infection with a vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. Several of our antibodies, including the broadly binding ones, protected mice from mortality despite lacking neutralization capability in vitro, suggesting their protection may be mediated by Fc-FcR interactions. Indeed, three antibodies displayed cellular phagocytosis and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Our antibodies, specifically the two identified cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (KL-2E5 and KL-2H7), might add to the understanding of anti-ebolavirus humoral immunity.

AB Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic emerging paramyxovirus that can cause fatal respiratory illness or encephalitis in humans. Despite many efforts, the molecular mechanisms of NiV-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remain unclear. We previously showed that NiV replicates to high titers in human lung grafts in NOD-SCID/gamma mice, resulting in a robust inflammatory response. Interestingly, these mice can undergo human immune system reconstitution by the bone marrow, liver, and thymus (BLT) reconstitution method, in addition to lung tissue engraftment, giving altogether a realistic model to study human respiratory viral infections. Here, we characterized NiV Bangladesh strain (NiV-B) infection of human lung grafts from human immune system-reconstituted mice in order to identify the overall effect of immune cells on NiV pathogenesis of the lung. We show that NiV-B replicated to high titers in human lung grafts and caused similar cytopathic effects irrespective of the presence of human leukocytes in mice. However, the human immune system interfered with virus spread across lung grafts, responded to infection by leukocyte migration to small airways and alveoli of the lung grafts, and accelerated oxidative stress in lung grafts. In addition, the presence of human leukocytes increased the expression of cytokines and chemokines that regulate inflammatory influx to sites of infection and tissue damage. These results advance our understanding of how the immune system limits NiV dissemination and contributes to ALI and inform efforts to identify therapeutic targets.
   IMPORTANCE Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging paramyxovirus that can cause a lethal respiratory and neurological disease in humans. Only limited data are available on NiV pathogenesis in the human lung, and the relative contribution of the innate immune response and NiV to acute lung injury (ALI) is still unknown. Using human lung grafts in a human immune system-reconstituted mouse model, we showed that the NiV Bangladesh strain induced cytopathic lesions in lung grafts similar to those described in patients irrespective of the donor origin or the presence of leukocytes. However, the human immune system interfered with virus spread, responded to infection by leukocyte infiltration in the small airways and alveolar area, induced oxidative stress, and triggered the production of cytokines and chemokines that regulate inflammatory influx by leukocytes in response to infection. Understanding how leukocytes interact with NiV and cause ALI in human lung xenografts is crucial for identifying therapeutic targets.

TI Cell Cycle-Dependent Expression of Adeno-Associated Virus 2 (AAV2) Rep
   in Coinfections with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) Gives Rise to a

AB Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) depends on the simultaneous presence of a helper virus such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) for productive replication. At the same time, AAV2 efficiently blocks the replication of HSV-1, which would eventually limit its own replication by diminishing the helper virus reservoir. This discrepancy begs the question of how AAV2 and HSV-1 can coexist in a cell population. Here we show that in coinfected cultures, AAV2 DNA replication takes place almost exclusively in S/G(2)-phase cells, while HSV-1 DNA replication is restricted to G(1) phase. Live microscopy revealed that not only wild-type AAV2 (wtAAV2) replication but also reporter gene expression from both single-stranded and double-stranded (self-complementary) recombinant AAV2 vectors preferentially occurs in S/G(2)-phase cells, suggesting that the preference for S/G(2) phase is independent of the nature of the viral genome. Interestingly, however, a substantial proportion of S/G(2)-phase cells transduced by the double-stranded but not the single-stranded recombinant AAV2 vectors progressed through mitosis in the absence of the helper virus. We conclude that cell cycle-dependent AAV2 rep expression facilitates cell cycle-dependent AAV2 DNA replication and inhibits HSV-1 DNA replication. This may limit competition for cellular and viral helper factors and, hence, creates a biological niche for either virus to replicate.
   IMPORTANCE Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) differs from most other viruses, as it requires not only a host cell for replication but also a helper virus such as an adenovirus or a herpesvirus. This situation inevitably leads to competition for cellular resources. AAV2 has been shown to efficiently inhibit the replication of helper viruses. Here we present a new facet of the interaction between AAV2 and one of its helper viruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). We observed that AAV2 rep gene expression is cell cycle dependent and gives rise to distinct time-controlled windows for HSV-1 replication. High Rep protein levels in S/G(2) phase support AAV2 replication and inhibit HSV-1 replication. Conversely, low Rep protein levels in G(1) phase permit HSV-1 replication but are insufficient for AAV2 replication. This allows both viruses to productively replicate in distinct sets of dividing cells.

AB Bats serve as a reservoir for various, often zoonotic viruses, including significant human pathogens such as Ebola and influenza viruses. However, for unknown reasons, viral infections rarely cause clinical symptoms in bats. A tight control of viral replication by the host innate immune defense might contribute to this phenomenon. Transcriptomic studies revealed the presence of the interferon-induced antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins in bats, but detailed functional aspects have not been assessed. To provide evidence that bat Mx proteins might act as key factors to control viral replication we cloned Mx1 cDNAs from three bat families, Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae. Phylogenetically these bat Mx1 genes cluster closely with their human ortholog MxA. Using transfected cell cultures, minireplicon systems, virus-like particles, and virus infections, we determined the antiviral potential of the bat Mx1 proteins. Bat Mx1 significantly reduced the polymerase activity of viruses circulating in bats, including Ebola and influenza A-like viruses. The related Thogoto virus, however, which is not known to infect bats, was not inhibited by bat Mx1. Further, we provide evidence for positive selection in bat Mx1 genes that might explain species-specific antiviral activities of these proteins. Together, our data suggest a role for Mx1 in controlling these viruses in their bat hosts.
   IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir for various viruses that rarely cause clinical symptoms in bats but are dangerous zoonotic pathogens, like Ebola or rabies virus. It has been hypothesized that the interferon system might play a key role in controlling viral replication in bats. We speculate that the interferon-induced Mx proteins might be key antiviral factors of bats and have coevolved with bat-borne viruses. This study evaluated for the first time a large set of bat Mx1 proteins spanning three major bat families for their antiviral potential, including activity against Ebola virus and bat influenza A-like virus, and we describe here their phylogenetic relationship, revealing patterns of positive selection that suggest a coevolution with viral pathogens. By understanding the molecular mechanisms of the innate resistance of bats against viral diseases, we might gain important insights into how to prevent and fight human zoonotic infections caused by bat-borne viruses.

AB The molecular constraints affecting Zika virus (ZIKV) evolution are not well understood. To investigate ZIKV genetic flexibility, we used transposon mutagenesis to add 15-nucleotide insertions throughout the ZIKV MR766 genome and subsequently deep sequenced the viable mutants. Few ZIKV insertion mutants replicated, which likely reflects a high degree of functional constraints on the genome. The NS1 gene exhibited distinct mutational tolerances at different stages of the screen. This result may define regions of the NS1 protein that are required for the different stages of the viral life cycle. The ZIKV structural genes showed the highest degree of insertional tolerance. Although the envelope (E) protein exhibited particular flexibility, the highly conserved envelope domain II (EDII) fusion loop of the E protein was intolerant of transposon insertions. The fusion loop is also a target of pan-flavivirus antibodies that are generated against other flaviviruses and neutralize a broad range of dengue virus and ZIKV isolates. The genetic restrictions identified within the epitopes in the EDII fusion loop likely explain the sequence and antigenic conservation of these regions in ZIKV and among multiple flaviviruses. Thus, our results provide insights into the genetic restrictions on ZIKV that may affect the evolution of this virus.
   IMPORTANCE Zika virus recently emerged as a significant human pathogen. Determining the genetic constraints on Zika virus is important for understanding the factors affecting viral evolution. We used a genome-wide transposon mutagenesis screen to identify where mutations were tolerated in replicating viruses. We found that the genetic regions involved in RNA replication were mostly intolerant of mutations. The genes coding for structural proteins were more permissive to mutations. Despite the flexibility observed in these regions, we found that epitopes bound by broadly reactive antibodies were genetically constrained. This finding may explain the genetic conservation of these epitopes among flaviviruses.

AB Virus-like vesicles (VLVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles that resemble native enveloped viruses in organization but lack the viral capsid and genome. During the productive infection of tumor-associated gammaherpesviruses, both virions and VLVs are produced and are released into the extracellular space. However, studies of gammaherpesvirus-associated VLVs have been largely restricted by the technical difficulty of separating VLVs from mature virions. Here we report a strategy of selectively isolating VLVs by using a Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) mutant that is defective in small capsid protein and is unable to produce mature virions. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we found that VLVs contained viral glycoproteins required for cellular entry, as well as tegument proteins involved in regulating lytic replication, but lacked capsid proteins. Functional analysis showed that VLVs induced the expression of the viral lytic activator RTA, initiating KSHV lytic gene expression. Furthermore, employing RNA sequencing, we performed a genome-wide analysis of cellular responses triggered by VLVs and found that PRDM1, a master regulator in cell differentiation, was significantly upregulated. In the context of KSHV replication, we demonstrated that VLV-induced upregulation of PRDM1 was necessary and sufficient to reactivate KSHV by activating its RTA promoter. In sum, our study systematically examined the composition of VLVs and demonstrated their biological roles in manipulating host cell responses and facilitating KSHV lytic replication.
   IMPORTANCE Cells lytically infected with tumor-associated herpesviruses produce a high proportion of virus-like vesicles (VLVs). The composition and function of VLVs have not been well defined, largely due to the inability to efficiently isolate VLVs that are free of virions. Using a cell system capable of establishing latent KSHV infection and robust reactivation, we successfully isolated VLVs from a KSHV mutant defective in the small capsid protein. We quantitatively analyzed proteins and microRNAs in VLVs and characterized the roles of VLVs in manipulating host cells and facilitating viral infection. More importantly, we demonstrated that by upregulating PRDM1 expression, VLVs triggered differentiation signaling in targeted cells and facilitated viral lytic infection via activation of the RTA promoter. Our study not only demonstrates a new strategy for isolating VLVs but also shows the important roles of KSHV-associated VLVs in intercellular communication and the viral life cycle.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) continues to cause substantial economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Heparan sulfate (HS) is used by PRRSV for initial attachment to target cells. However, the role of HS in the late phase of PRRSV infection and the mechanism of virus release from host cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection caused a decrease in HS expression and upregulated heparanase, the only known enzyme capable of degrading HS. We subsequently demonstrated that the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and cathepsin L protease were involved in regulation of PRRSV infection-induced heparanase. In addition, we found that ablation of heparanase expression using small interfering RNA duplexes increased cell surface expression of HS and suppressed PRRSV replication and release, whereas overexpression of heparanase reduced HS surface expression and enhanced PRRSV replication and release. These data suggest that PRRSV activates NF-kappa B and cathepsin L to upregulate and process heparanase, and then the active heparanase cleaves HS, resulting in viral release. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of PRRSV egress from host cells, which might help us to further understand PRRSV pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes great economic losses each year to the pig industry worldwide. The molecular mechanism of PRRSV release from host cells largely remains a mystery. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV activates NF-kappa B and cathepsin L to upregulate and process heparanase, and then the active heparanase is released to the extracellular space and exerts enzymatic activity to cleave heparan sulfate, resulting in viral release. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of PRRSV egress from host cells, which might help us to further understand PRRSV pathogenesis.

AB The herpes simplex virus (HSV) capsid is released into the cytoplasm after fusion of viral and host membranes, whereupon dynein-dependent trafficking along microtubules targets it to the nuclear envelope. Binding of the capsid to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by the capsid protein pUL25 and the capsid-tethered tegument protein pUL36. Temperature-sensitive mutants in both pUL25 and pUL36 dock at the NPC but fail to release DNA. The uncoating reaction has been difficult to study due to the rapid release of the genome once the capsid interacts with the nuclear pore. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a truncation mutant of pUL25. Live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the mutant was not impaired in penetration of the host cell or in trafficking of the capsid to the nuclear membrane. However, expression of viral proteins was absent or significantly delayed in cells infected with the pUL25 mutant virus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed capsids accumulated at nuclear pores that retained the viral genome for at least 4 h postinfection. In addition, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of virion capsids did not detect any obvious differences in the location or structural organization for the pUL25 or pUL36 proteins on the pUL25 mutant capsids. Further, in contrast to wild-type virus, the antiviral response mediated by the viral DNA-sensing cyclic guanine adenine synthase (cGAS) was severely compromised for the pUL25 mutant. These results demonstrate that the pUL25 capsid protein has a critical role in releasing viral DNA from NPC-bound capsids.
   IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the causative agent of several pathologies ranging in severity from the common cold sore to life-threatening encephalitic infection. Early steps in infection include release of the capsid into the cytoplasm, docking of the capsid at a nuclear pore, and release of the viral genome into the nucleus. A key knowledge gap is how the capsid engages the NPC and what triggers release of the viral genome into the nucleus. Here we show that the C-terminal region of the HSV-1 pUL25 protein is required for releasing the viral genome from capsids docked at nuclear pores. The significance of our research is in identifying pUL25 as a key viral factor for genome uncoating. pUL25 is found at each of the capsid vertices as part of the capsid vertex-specific component and implicates the importance of this complex for NPC binding and genome release.

AB The I2L open reading frame of vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes a conserved 72-amino-acid protein with a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain. Previous studies with a tetracycline-inducible mutant demonstrated that I2-deficient virions are defective in cell entry. The purpose of the present study was to determine the step of replication or entry that is affected by loss of the I2 protein. Fluorescence microscopy experiments showed that I2 colocalized with a major membrane protein of immature and mature virions. We generated a cell line that constitutively expressed I2 and allowed construction of the VACV I2L deletion mutant v Delta I2. As anticipated, v Delta I2 was unable to replicate in cells that did not express I2. Unexpectedly, morphogenesis was interrupted at a stage after immature virion formation, resulting in the accumulation of dense spherical particles instead of brick-shaped mature virions with well-defined core structures. The abnormal particles retained the D13 scaffold protein of immature virions, were severely deficient in the transmembrane proteins that comprise the entry fusion complex (EFC), and had increased amounts of unprocessed membrane and core proteins. Total lysates of cells infected with v Delta I2 also had diminished EFC proteins due to instability attributed to their hydrophobicity and failure to be inserted into viral membranes. A similar instability of EFC proteins had previously been found with unrelated mutants blocked earlier in morphogenesis that also accumulated viral membranes retaining the D13 scaffold. We concluded that I2 is required for virion morphogenesis, release of the D13 scaffold, and the association of EFC proteins with viral membranes.
   IMPORTANCE Poxviruses comprise a large family that infect vertebrates and invertebrates, cause disease in both in humans and in wild and domesticated animals, and are being engineered as vectors for vaccines and cancer therapy. In addition, investigations of poxviruses have provided insights into many aspects of cell biology. The I2 protein is conserved in all poxviruses that infect vertebrates, suggesting an important role. The present study revealed that this protein is essential for vaccinia virus morphogenesis and that its absence results in an accumulation of deformed virus particles retaining the scaffold protein and deficient in surface proteins needed for cell entry.

TI Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Augments mRNA
   Translation

AB Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, causing severe illness with high mortality rates in humans. Here, we demonstrate that CCHFV nucleocapsid protein (CCHFV-NP) augments mRNA translation. CCHFV-NP binds to the viral mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) with high affinity. It facilitates the translation of reporter mRNA both in vivo and in vitro with the assistance of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. CCHFV-NP equally favors the translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs, demonstrating the independence of this translation strategy on the 5' cap. Unlike the canonical host translation machinery, inhibition of eIF4F complex, an amalgam of three initiation factors, eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E, by the chemical inhibitor 4E1RCat did not impact the CCHFV-NP-mediated translation mechanism. However, the proteolytic degradation of eIF4G alone by the human rhinovirus 2A protease abrogated this translation strategy. Our results demonstrate that eIF4F complex formation is not required but eIF4G plays a critical role in this translation mechanism. Our results suggest that CCHFV has adopted a unique translation mechanism to facilitate the translation of viral mRNAs in the host cell cytoplasm where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation apparatus.
   IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a highly contagious viral disease endemic to more than 30 countries, has limited treatment options. Our results demonstrate that NP favors the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the viral mRNA 5' UTR. It is highly likely that CCHFV uses an NP-mediated translation strategy for the rapid synthesis of viral proteins during the course of infection. Shutdown of this translation mechanism might selectively impact viral protein synthesis, suggesting that an NP-mediated translation strategy is a target for therapeutic intervention against this viral disease.

AB Mus musculus papillomavirus 1 (MmuPV1/MusPV1) induces persistent papillomas in immunodeficient mice but not in common laboratory strains. To facilitate the study of immune control, we sought an outbred and immunocompetent laboratory mouse strain in which persistent papillomas could be established. We found that challenge of SKH1 mice (Crl:SKH1-Hrhr) with MmuPV1 by scarification on their tail resulted in three clinical outcomes: (i) persistent (similar to 2-month) papillomas (similar to 20%); (ii) transient papillomas that spontaneously regress, typically within 2 months (similar to 15%); and (iii) no visible papillomas and viral clearance (similar to 65%). SKH1 mice with persistent papillomas were treated by using a candidate preventive/therapeutic naked-DNA vaccine that expresses human calreticulin (hCRT) fused in frame to MmuPV1 E6 (mE6) and mE7 early proteins and residues 11 to 200 of the late protein L2 (hCRTmE6/mE7/mL2). Three intramuscular DNA vaccinations were delivered biweekly via in vivo electroporation, and both humoral and CD8 T cell responses were mapped and measured. Previously persistent papillomas disappeared within 2 months after the final vaccination. Coincident virologic clearance was confirmed by in situ hybridization and a failure of disease to recur after CD3 T cell depletion. Vaccination induced strong mE6 and mE7 CD8(+) T cell responses in all mice, although they were significantly weaker in mice that initially presented with persistent warts than in those that spontaneously cleared their infection. A human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)-targeted version of the DNA vaccine also induced L2 antibodies and protected mice from vaginal challenge with an HPV16 pseudovirus. Thus, MmuPV1 challenge of SKH1 mice is a promising model of spontaneous and immunotherapy directed clearances of HPV-related disease.
   IMPORTANCE High-risk-type human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) cause 5% of all cancer cases worldwide, notably cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. Since preventative HPV vaccines have not been widely used in many countries and do not impact existing infections, there is considerable interest in the development of therapeutic vaccines to address existing disease and infections. The strict tropism of HPV requires the use of animal papillomavirus models for therapeutic vaccine development. However, MmuPV1 failed to grow in common laboratory strains of mice with an intact immune system. We show that MmuPV1 challenge of the outbred immunocompetent SKH1 strain produces both transient and persistent papillomas and that vaccination of the mice with a DNA expressing an MmuPV1 E6E7L2 fusion with calreticulin can rapidly clear persistent papillomas. Furthermore, an HPV16-targeted version of the DNA can protect against vaginal challenge with HPV16, suggesting

AB The envelope glycoproteins (Envs) on the surfaces of HIV-1 particles are targeted by host antibodies. Primary HIV-1 isolates demonstrate different global sensitivities to antibody neutralization; tier-1 isolates are sensitive, whereas tier-2 isolates are more resistant. Single-site mutations in Env can convert tier-2 into tier-1-like viruses. We hypothesized that such global change in neutralization sensitivity results from weakening of intramolecular interactions that maintain Env integrity. Three strategies commonly applied to perturb protein structure were tested for their effects on global neutralization sensitivity: exposure to low temperature, Env-activating ligands, and a chaotropic agent. A large panel of diverse tier-2 isolates from clades B and C was analyzed. Incubation at 0 degrees C, which globally weakens hydrophobic interactions, causes gradual and reversible exposure of the coreceptorbinding site. In the cold-induced state, Envs progress at isolate-specific rates to unstable forms that are sensitive to antibody neutralization and then gradually lose function. Agents that mimic the effects of CD4 (CD4Ms) also induce reversible structural changes to states that exhibit isolate-specific stabilities. The chaotropic agent urea (at low concentrations) does not affect the structure or function of native Env. However, urea efficiently perturbs metastable states induced by cold and CD4Ms and increases their sensitivity to antibody neutralization and their inactivation rates Therefore, chemical and physical agents can guide Env from the stable native state to perturbation-sensitive forms and modulate their stability to bestow tier-1-like properties on primary tier-2 strains. These concepts can be applied to enhance the potency of vaccine-elicited antibodies and microbicides at mucosal sites of HIV-1 transmission.
   IMPORTANCE An effective vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV-1 is a primary goal of the scientific and health care communities. Vaccine-elicited antibodies target the viral envelope glycoproteins (Envs) and can potentially inhibit infection. However, the potency of such antibodies is generally low. Single-site mutations in Env can enhance the global sensitivity of HIV-1 to neutralization by antibodies. We found that such a hypersensitivity phenotype can also be induced by agents that destabilize protein structure. Exposure to 0 degrees C or low concentrations of Env-activating ligands gradually guides Env to metastable forms that expose cryptic epitopes and that are highly sensitive to neutralization. Low concentrations of the chaotropic agent urea do not affect native Env but destabilize perturbed states induced by cold or CD4Ms and increase their neutralization. The concept of enhancing antibody sensitivity by chemical agents that affect the structural stability of proteins can be applied to increase the potency of topical microbicides and vaccine-elicited antibodies.

AB Passive immunotherapy against HIV-1 will most likely require broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with maximum breadth and potency to ensure therapeutic efficacy. Recently, the novel CD4 binding site antibody N6 demonstrated extraordinary neutralization breadth and potency against large panels of cross-clade pseudoviruses. We evaluated the in vivo antiviral activity of N6-LS, alone or in combination with the established V3-glycan antibody PGT121, in chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-SF162P3-infected macaques. A single dose of N6-LS suppressed plasma viral loads in 4 out of 5 animals at day 7, while the combination of both antibodies suppressed all animals. The combination of both antibodies had no additive antiviral effect compared to a single dose of PGT121, potentially reflecting the nearly 10-fold-higher potency of PGT121 against this SHIV. Viral rebound occurred in the majority of suppressed animals and was linked to declining plasma bnAb levels over time. In addition to the effect on plasma viremia, bnAb administration resulted in significantly reduced proviral DNA levels in PBMCs after 2 weeks and in lymph nodes after 10 weeks. Autologous neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and CD8(+) T-cell responses were not significantly enhanced in the bnAb-treated animals compared to control animals, arguing against their contribution to the viral effects observed. These results confirm the robust antiviral activity of N6-LS in vivo, supporting the further clinical development of this antibody.
   IMPORTANCE Monocloncal antibodies (MAbs) are being considered for passive immunotherapy of HIV-1 infection. A critical requirement for such strategies is the identification of MAbs that recognize the diversity of variants within circulating but also reservoir viruses, and MAb combinations might be needed to achieve this goal. This study evaluates the novel bnAb N6-LS alone or in combination with the bnAb PGT121, in rhesus macaques that were chronically infected with SHIV. The results demonstrate that N6-LS potently suppressed plasma viral loads in the majority of animals but that the combination with PGT121 was not superior to PGT121 alone in delaying time to viral rebound or reducing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) or lymph node proviral DNA levels. The occurrence of viral escape variants in an N6-LS-monotreated animal, however, argues for the need to maximize breadth and antiviral efficacy by combining bnAbs for therapeutic indications.

AB Arenaviruses are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. These viruses encode only four proteins to accomplish the viral life cycle, so each arenavirus protein likely plays unappreciated accessory roles during infection. Here we used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify human proteins that interact with the nucleoproteins (NPs) of the Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and the New World arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV) strain Candid #1. Bioinformatic analysis of the identified protein partners of NP revealed that host translation appears to be a key biological process engaged during infection. In particular, NP associates with the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), a well-characterized antiviral protein that inhibits cap-dependent protein translation initiation via phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha. JUNV infection leads to increased expression of PKR as well as its redistribution to viral replication and transcription factories. Further, phosphorylation of PKR, which is a prerequisite for its ability to phosphorylate eIF2 alpha, is readily induced by JUNV. However, JUNV prevents this pool of activated PKR from phosphorylating eIF2 alpha, even following exposure to the synthetic dsRNA poly(I.C), a potent PKR agonist. This blockade of PKR function is highly specific, as LCMV is unable to similarly inhibit eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. JUNV's ability to antagonize the antiviral activity of PKR appears to be complete, as silencing of PKR expression has no impact on viral propagation. In summary, we provide a detailed map of the host machinery engaged by arenavirus NPs and identify an antiviral pathway that is subverted by JUNV.
   IMPORTANCE Arenaviruses are important human pathogens for which FDA-approved vaccines do not exist and effective antiviral therapeutics are needed. Design of antiviral treatment options and elucidation of the mechanistic basis of disease pathogenesis will depend on an increased basic understanding of these viruses and, in particular, their interactions with the host cell machinery. Identifying host proteins critical for the viral life cycle and/or pathogenesis represents a useful strategy to uncover new drug targets. This study reveals, for the first time, the extensive human protein interactome of arenavirus nucleoproteins and uncovers a potent antiviral host protein that is neutralized during Junin virus infection. In so doing, it shows further insight into the interplay between the virus and the host innate immune response and provides an important data set for the field.

AB Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human gammaherpesvirus that establishes a latency reservoir in B cells. In this work, we show that ibrutinib, idelalisib, and dasatinib, drugs that block B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and are used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, block BCR-mediated lytic induction at clinically relevant doses. We confirm that the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus also inhibit BCR-mediated lytic induction but find that rapamycin does not inhibit BCR-mediated lytic induction. Further investigation shows that mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) contributes to BCR-mediated lytic induction and that FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) binding alone is not adequate to block activation. Finally, we show that BCR signaling can activate EBV lytic induction in freshly isolated B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and that activation can be inhibited by ibrutinib or idelalisib.

AB RNA viruses are one of the fastest-evolving biological entities. Within their hosts, they exist as genetically diverse populations (i.e., viral mutant swarms), which are sculpted by different evolutionary mechanisms, such as mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift, and also the interactions between genetic variants within the mutant swarms. To elucidate the mechanisms that modulate the population diversity of an important plant-pathogenic virus, we performed evolution experiments with Potato virus Y (PVY) in potato genotypes that differ in their defense response against the virus. Using deep sequencing of small RNAs, we followed the temporal dynamics of standing and newly generated variations in the evolving viral lineages. A time-sampled approach allowed us to (i) reconstruct theoretical haplo-types in the starting population by using clustering of single nucleotide polymorphisms' trajectories and (ii) use quantitative population genetics approaches to estimate the contribution of selection and genetic drift, and their interplay, to the evolution of the virus. We detected imprints of strong selective sweeps and narrow genetic bottlenecks, followed by the shift in frequency of selected haplotypes. Comparison of patterns of viral evolution in differently susceptible host genotypes indicated possible diversifying evolution of PVY in the less-susceptible host (efficient in the accumulation of salicylic acid).

AB Dok-1 and Dok-2 negatively regulate responses downstream of several immune receptors in lymphoid and myeloid cells. Recent evidence showed that Dok proteins are essential in the formation of memory CD8(+) T cells to an exogenous epitope expressed by vaccinia virus; however, the importance of Dok-1 and Dok-2 in the control of viral infection is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Dok proteins in modulating the immune response against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in a mouse model of ocular infection. During acute infection, viral titers in the eye were similar in wild-type (WT) and Dok-1 and Dok-2 double-knockout (DKO) mice, and the percentages of infiltrating leukocytes were similar in DKO and WT corneas and trigeminal ganglia (TG). DKO mice exhibited a diminished CD8(+) T cell response to the immunodominant HSV-1 glycoprotein B (gB) epitope in the spleen and draining lymph nodes compared to WT mice during acute infection. Remarkably, gB-specific CD8(+) T cells almost completely disappeared in the spleens of DKO mice during latency, and the reduction of CD8(+) effector memory T (Tem) cells was more severe than that of CD8(+) central memory T (Tcm) cells. The percentage of gB-specific CD8(+) T cells in TG during latency was also dramatically reduced in DKO mice; however, they were phenotypically similar to those from WT mice. In ex vivo assays, reactivation was detected earlier in TG cultures from infected DKO versus WT mice. Thus, Dok-1 and Dok-2 promote survival of gB-specific CD8(+) T cells in TG latently infected with HSV-1.
   IMPORTANCE HSV-1 establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons of trigeminal ganglia (TG). In humans, HSV-1 is able to sporadically reactivate from latently infected neurons and establish a lytic infection at a site to which the neurons project. Most herpetic disease in humans is due to reactivation of HSV-1 from latency rather than to primary acute infection. CD8(+) T cells are thought to play an important role in controlling recurrent infections. In this study, we examined the involvement of Dok-1 and Dok-2 signaling proteins in the control of HSV-1 infection. We provide evidence that Dok proteins are required to maintain a CD8(+) T cell response against HSV-1 during latency-especially CD8(+) Tem cells-and that they negatively affect HSV-1 reactivation from latency. Elucidating Dok-mediated mechanisms involved in the control of HSV-1 reactivation from latency might contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent recurrent HSV-1-induced pathology.

AB Macrophages are the predominant infiltrate in the corneas of mice that have been ocularly infected with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). However, very little is known about the relative roles of M1 (classically activated or polarized) and M2 (alternatively activated or polarized) macrophages in ocular HSV-1 infection. To better understand these relationships, we assessed the impact of directed M1 or M2 activation of RAW264.7 macrophages and peritoneal macrophages (PM) on subsequent HSV-1 infection. In both the RAW264.7 macrophage and PM in vitro models, HSV-1 replication in M1 macrophages was markedly lower than in M2 macrophages and unstimulated controls. The M1 macrophages expressed significantly higher levels of 28 of the 32 tested cytokines and chemokines than M2 macrophages, with HSV-1 infection significantly increasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the M1 versus the M2 macrophages. To examine the effects of shifting the immune response toward either M1 or M2 macrophages in vivo, wild-type mice were injected with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) DNA or colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) DNA prior to ocular infection with HSV-1. Virus replication in the eye, latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG), and markers of T cell exhaustion in the TG were determined. We found that injection of mice with IFN-gamma DNA, which enhances the development of M1 macrophages, increased virus replication in the eye; increased latency; and also increased CD4, CD8, IFN-gamma, and PD-1 transcripts in the TG of latently infected mice. Conversely, injection of mice with CSF-1 DNA, which enhances the development of M2 macrophages, was associated with reduced virus replication in the eye and reduced latency and reduced the levels of CD4, CD8, IFN-gamma, and PD-1 transcripts in the TG. Collectively, these results suggest that M2 macrophages directly reduce the levels of HSV-1 latency and, thus, T-cell exhaustion in the TG of ocularly infected mice.
   IMPORTANCE Our findings demonstrate a novel approach to further reducing HSV-1 replication in the eye and latency in the TG by modulating immune components, specifically, by altering the phenotype of macrophages. We suggest that inclusion of CSF-1 as part of any vaccination regimen against HSV infection to coax responses of macrophages toward an M2, rather than an M1, response may further improve vaccine efficacy against ocular HSV-1 replication and latency.

AB There are seven antigenically distinct serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), each of which has intratypic variants. In the present study, we have developed methods to efficiently generate promising vaccines against seven serotypes or subtypes. The capsid-encoding gene (P1) of the vaccine strain O1/Manisa/Turkey/69 was replaced with the amplified or synthetic genes from the O, A, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3 serotypes. Viruses of the seven serotype were rescued successfully. Each chimeric FMDV with a replacement of P1 showed serotypespecific antigenicity and varied in terms of pathogenesis in pigs and mice. Vaccination of pigs with an experimental trivalent vaccine containing the inactivated recombinants based on the main serotypes O, A, and Asia1 effectively protected them from virus challenge. This technology could be a potential strategy for a customized vaccine with challenge tools to protect against epizootic disease caused by specific serotypes or subtypes of FMDV.
   IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) causes significant economic losses. For vaccine preparation, the selection of vaccine strains was complicated by high antigenic variation. In the present study, we suggested an effective strategy to rapidly prepare and evaluate mass-produced customized vaccines against epidemic strains. The P1 gene encoding the structural proteins of the well-known vaccine virus was replaced by the synthetic or amplified genes of viruses of seven representative serotypes. These chimeric viruses generally replicated readily in cell culture and had a particle size similar to that of the original vaccine strain. Their antigenicity mirrored that of the original serotype from which their P1 gene was derived. Animal infection experiments revealed that the recombinants varied in terms of pathogenicity. This strategy will be a useful tool for rapidly generating customized FMD vaccines or challenge viruses for all serotypes, especially for FMD-free countries, which have prohibited the import of FMDVs.

AB There is growing interest in utilizing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate infected cells following reactivation from HIV-1 latency. A potential barrier is that HIV-1-specific ADCC antibodies decline in patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may not be sufficient to eliminate reactivated latently infected cells. It is not known whether reactivation from latency with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) could provide sufficient antigenic stimulus to boost HIV-1-specific ADCC. We found that treatment with the LRA panobinostat or a short analytical treatment interruption (ATI), 21 to 59 days, was not sufficient to stimulate an increase in ADCC-competent antibodies, despite viral rebound in all subjects who underwent the short ATI. In contrast, a longer ATI, 2 to 12 months, among subjects enrolled in the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial robustly boosted HIV-1 gp120-specific Fc receptor-binding antibodies and ADCC against HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. These results show that there is a lag between viral recrudescence and the boosting of ADCC antibodies, which has implications for strategies toward eliminating latently infected cells.
   IMPORTANCE The "shock and kill" HIV-1 cure strategy aims to reactivate HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells and subsequently eliminate the reactivated cells through immune-mediated killing. Several latency reversing agents (LRAs) have been examined in vivo, but LRAs alone have not been able to achieve HIV-1 remission and prevent viral rebound following analytical treatment interruption (ATI). In this study, we examined whether LRA treatment or ATI can provide sufficient antigenic stimulus to boost HIV-1-specific functional antibodies that can eliminate HIV-1-infected cells. Our study has implications for the antigenic stimulus required for antilatency strategies and/or therapeutic vaccines to boost functional antibodies and assist in eliminating the latent reservoir.

AB Interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and lipoproteins in humans play an important role in the efficient establishment of chronic infection. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) on the HCV envelope mediates virus attachment to host cells as well as immune evasion. This interaction is thought to occur in hepatocytes, as ApoE plays dual functions in HCV assembly and maturation as well as cell attachment. In the present study, we found that secreted ApoE (sApoE) can also bind to viral particles via its C-terminal domain after HCV is released from the cell. Furthermore, the binding affinity of interactions between the sApoE N terminus and cell surface receptors affected HCV infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. The extracellular binding of sApoE to HCV is dependent on HCV envelope proteins, and recombinant HCV envelope proteins are also able to bind to sApoE. These results suggest that extracellular interactions between HCV and sApoE may potentially complicate vaccine development and studies of viral pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE End-stage liver disease caused by chronic HCV infection remains a clinical challenge, and there is an urgent need for a prophylactic method of controlling HCV infection. Because host immunity against HCV is poorly understood, additional investigations of host-virus interactions in the context of HCV are important. HCV is primarily transmitted through blood, which is rich in lipoproteins. Therefore, it is of interest to further determine how HCV interacts with lipoproteins in human blood. In this study, we found that secreted ApoE (sApoE), an exchangeable component found in lipoproteins, participates in extracellular interactions with HCV virions. More significantly, different variants of sApoE differentially affect HCV infection efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. These findings provide greater insight into HCV infection and host immunity and could help propel the development of new strategies for preventing HCV infection.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide, but it lacks a licensed vaccine or suitable antiviral drug. A live attenuated chimeric bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 (rB/HPIV3) was developed previously as a vector expressing RSV fusion (F) protein to confer bivalent protection against RSV and HPIV3. In a previous clinical trial in virus-naive children, rB/HPIV3 was well tolerated but the immunogenicity of wild-type RSV F was unsatisfactory. We previously modified RSV F with a designed disulfide bond (DS) to increase stability in the prefusion (pre-F) conformation and to be efficiently packaged in the vector virion. Here, we further stabilized pre-F by adding both disulfide and cavity-filling mutations (DS-Cav1), and we also modified RSV F codon usage to have a lower CpG content and a higher level of expression. This RSV F open reading frame was evaluated in rB/HPIV3 in three forms: (i) pre-F without vector-packaging signal, (ii) pre-F with vector-packaging signal, and (iii) secreted pre-F ectodomain trimer. Despite being efficiently expressed, the secreted pre-F was poorly immunogenic. DS-Cav1 stabilized pre-F, with or without packaging, induced higher titers of pre-F specific antibodies in hamsters, and improved the quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies. Codon-optimized RSV F containing fewer CpG dinucleotides had higher F expression, replicated more efficiently in vivo, and was more immunogenic. The combination of DS-Cav1 pre-F stabilization, optimized codon usage, reduced CpG content, and vector packaging significantly improved vector immunogenicity and protective efficacy against RSV. This provides an improved vectored RSV vaccine candidate suitable for pediatric clinical evaluation.
   IMPORTANCE RSV and HPIV3 are the first and second leading viral causes of severe pediatric respiratory disease worldwide. Licensed vaccines or suitable antiviral drugs are not available. We are developing a chimeric rB/HPIV3 vector expressing RSV F as a bivalent RSV/HPIV3 vaccine and have been evaluating means to increase RSV F immunogenicity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of improved stabilization of F in the pre-F conformation and of codon optimization resulting in reduced CpG content and greater pre-F expression. Reduced CpG content dampened the interferon response to infection, promoting higher replication and increased F expression. We demonstrate that improved pre-F stabilization and strategic manipulation of codon usage, together with efficient pre-F packaging into vector virions, significantly increased F immunogenicity in the bivalent RSV/HPIV3 vaccine. The improved immunogenicity included induction of increased titers of high-quality complement-independent antibodies with greater pre-F site O binding and greater protection against RSV challenge.

AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X protein (HBx) plays a critical role in HBV-related hepatocarcinoma development. In this study, we demonstrate that HBx is specifically modified by NEDD8. We found that E3 ligase HDM2 promotes NEDDylation of HBx to enhance HBx stability by preventing its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Consistently, analysis of 160 hepatocellular carcinoma patient specimens indicated that the amount of HDM2 protein correlates with HBx protein level. We identified that HBx K91 and K95 as the key HBx NEDDylation sites and observed that the NEDDylation-deficient HBx has shorter half-life. We generated Huh7 cell lines which ectopically express wild-type and NEDDylation-deficient HBx and found that NEDDylation-deficient HBx showed less chromatin localization and less DDB1 binding. Consistently, the expression of HBx-regulated genes (IL-8, MMP9, and YAP) and HBV transcription (the activity of HBV enhancer and the amount of pgRNA transcribed from cccDNA) were significantly higher in cells expressing wild-type (WT) HBx than that in cells expressing mutant HBx. In addition, HBx-expressing cells proliferated faster than control and mutant HBx-expressing cells. We also showed that the ability of WT HBx-expressing cells to form tumors in nude mice was significantly higher than that of mutant HBx-expressing cells. In conclusion, we revealed that E3 ligase HDM2 promotes NEDDylation of HBx to enhance HBx stability and chromatin localization, which in turn favors HBx-dependent transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, and HBV-driven tumor growth.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus (HBV) HBx protein plays a critical role in viral replication and hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the regulation of HBx stability is not well understood. We found that HBx is modified by NEDD8 and that the HDM2 E3 ligase promotes HBx NEDDylation to enhance HBx stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination. We provide a new evidence to show the positive correlation between HDM2 and HBx in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. We also identified the major NEDDylation sites on HBx. Our studies indicate that the defective NEDDylation of HBx negatively affects its ability to activate the transcription of downstream genes and promote cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel posttranslational modification of HBx by HDM2 which regulates its stability, subcellular localization, and functions. These findings indicate that HDM2 is an important regulator on HBx and a potential diagnosis/ therapeutic marker for HBV-associated HCC.

AB Rotavirus infection is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in humans. In neonatal mice, rhesus rotavirus (RRV) can induce biliary atresia (BA), a disease resulting in inflammatory obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tract and intrahepatic bile ducts. We previously showed that the amino acid arginine (R) within the sequence SRL (amino acids 445 to 447) in the RRV VP4 protein is required for viral binding and entry into biliary epithelial cells. To determine if this single amino acid (R) influences the pathogenicity of the virus, we generated a recombinant virus with a single amino acid mutation at this site through a reverse genetics system. We demonstrated that the RRV mutant (RRVVP4-R446G) produced less symptomatology and replicated to lower titers both in vivo and in vitro than those seen with wild-type RRV, with reduced binding in cholangiocytes. Our results demonstrate that a single amino acid change in the RRV VP4 gene influences cholangiocyte tropism and reduces pathogenicity in mice.
   IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhea in humans. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) can also lead to biliary atresia (a neonatal human disease) in mice. We developed a reverse genetics system to create a mutant of RRV (RRVVP4-R446G) with a single amino acid change in the VP4 protein compared to that of wild-type RRV. In vitro, the mutant virus had reduced binding and infectivity in cholangiocytes. In vivo, it produced fewer symptoms and lower mortality in neonatal mice, resulting in an attenuated form of biliary atresia.

TI Chikungunya Virus Overcomes Polyamine Depletion by Mutation of nsP1 and
   the Opal Stop Codon To Confer Enhanced Replication and Fitness

AB Polyamines, which are small positively charge molecules present in all cells, play important roles in the replication of DNA and RNA viruses. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) relies on polyamines for translation of the viral genome upon viral entry, and pharmacological depletion of polyamines limits viral replication. However, the potential development of antiviral resistance necessitates a better understanding of how polyamines function and can be targeted via compounds that alter polyamine levels. We have isolated CHIKV that is resistant to polyamine depletion and contains two mutations in the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1)-coding region in combination with a mutation to the opal stop codon preceding nsP4. These mutations, in addition to promoting viral replication in polyamine-depleted cells, confer enhanced viral replication in vitro and in vivo. The nsP1 mutations enhance membrane binding and methyltransferase activities, while the stop codon mutation allows increased downstream translation. These mutations, when combined, enhance viral fitness, but individual mutants are attenuated in mosquitoes. Together, our results suggest that CHIKV can evolve resistance to polyamine depletion and that pharmaceuticals targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway may be best used in combination with other established antivirals to mitigate the development of resistance.
   IMPORTANCE Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-borne virus that has infected millions worldwide. Its expansion into the Americas and rapid adaptation to new mosquito hosts present a serious threat to human health, which we can combat with the development of antiviral therapies as well as understanding how these viruses will mutate when exposed to antiviral therapies. Targeting polyamines, small positively charged molecules in the cell, may be a potential strategy against RNA viruses, including chikungunya virus. Here, we have described a virus that is resistant to polyamine depletion and has increased fitness in cells and in full organisms. Mutations in viral genome capping machinery, membrane binding activity, and a stop codon arise, and their altered activities enhance replication in the absence of polyamines. These results highlight strategies by which chikungunya virus can overcome polyamine depletion and emphasize continued research on developing improved antiviral therapies.

AB Akabane virus (AKAV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) are members of the genus Orthobunyavirus, which are transmitted by arthropod vectors with a broad cellular tropism in vitro as well as in vivo. Both AKAV and SBV cause arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome in ruminants. The main cellular receptor and attachment factor for entry of these orthobunyaviruses are unknown. Here, we found that AKAV and SBV infections were inhibited by the addition of heparin or enzymatic removal of cell surface heparan sulfates. To confirm this finding, we prepared heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-knockout (KO) cells by using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system and measured the quantities of binding of these viruses to cell surfaces. We observed a substantial reduction in AKAV and SBV binding to cells, limiting the infections by these viruses. These data demonstrate that HSPGs are important cellular attachment factors for AKAV and SBV, at least in vitro, to promote virus replication in susceptible cells.
   IMPORTANCE AKAV and SBV are the etiological agents of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome in ruminants, which causes considerable economic losses in the livestock industry. Here, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycan as a major cellular attachment factor for the entry of AKAV and SBV. Moreover, we found that heparin is a strong inhibitor of AKAV and SBV infections. Revealing the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interactions is critical in order to understand virus biology and develop novel live attenuated vaccines.

AB Microtubules (MTs) form a rapidly adaptable network of filaments that radiate throughout the cell. These dynamic arrays facilitate a wide range of cellular processes, including the capture, transport, and spatial organization of cargos and organelles, as well as changes in cell shape, polarity, and motility. Nucleating from MT-organizing centers, including but by no means limited to the centrosome, MTs undergo rapid transitions through phases of growth, pause, and catastrophe, continuously exploring and adapting to the intracellular environment. Subsets of MTs can become stabilized in response to environmental cues, acquiring distinguishing post-translational modifications and performing discrete functions as specialized tracks for cargo trafficking. The dynamic behavior and organization of the MT array is regulated by MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which include a subset of highly specialized plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) that respond to signaling cues to alter MT behavior. As pathogenic cargos, viruses require MTs to transport to and from their intracellular sites of replication. While interactions with and functions for MT motor proteins are well characterized and extensively reviewed for many viruses, this review focuses on MT filaments themselves. Changes in the spatial organization and dynamics of the MT array, mediated by virus- or host-induced changes to MT regulatory proteins, not only play a central role in the intracellular transport of virus particles but also regulate a wider range of processes critical to the outcome of infection.

AB Ample evidence exists for the presence of infectious agents at the maternal-fetal interface, often with grave outcomes to the developing fetus (i.e., Zika virus, brucella, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma). While less studied, pregnancy-related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have been implicated in several species, including humans. Our previous work has shown that prions can be transferred from mother to offspring, resulting in the development of clinical TSE disease in offspring born to muntjac dams infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) (1). We further demonstrated protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA)-competent prions within the female reproductive tract and in fetal tissues harvested from CWD experimentally and naturally exposed cervids (1, 2). To assess whether the PMCA-competent prions residing at the maternal-fetal interface were infectious and to determine if the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) methodology may enhance our ability to detect amyloid fibrils within the pregnancy microenvironment, we employed a mouse bioassay and RT-QuIC. In this study, we have demonstrated RT-QuIC seeding activity in uterus, placentome, ovary, and amniotic fluid but not in allantoic fluids harvested from CWD-infected Reeves' muntjac dams showing clinical signs of infection (clinically CWD-infected) and in some placentomes from pre-clinically CWD-infected dams. Prion infectivity was confirmed within the uterus, amniotic fluid, and the placentome, the semipermeable interface that sustains the developing fetus, of CWD-infected dams. This is the first report of prion infectivity within the cervid pregnancy microenvironment, revealing a source of fetal CWD exposure prior to the birthing process, maternal grooming, or encounters with contaminated environments.
   IMPORTANCE The facile dissemination of chronic wasting disease within captive and free-range cervid populations has led to questions regarding the transmission dynamics of this disease. Direct contact with infected animals and indirect contact with infectious prions in bodily fluids and contaminated environments are suspected to explain the majority of this transmission. A third mode of transmission, from mother to offspring, may be underappreciated. The presence of pregnancy-related prion infectivity within the uterus, amniotic fluid, and the placental structure reveals that the developing fetus is exposed to a source of prions long before exposure to the infectious agent during and after the birthing process or via contact with contaminated environments. These findings have impact on our current concept of CWD disease transmission.

AB The vaccinia virus B1 kinase is highly conserved among poxviruses and is essential for the viral life cycle. B1 exhibits a remarkable degree of similarity to vaccinia virus-related kinases (VRKs), a family of cellular kinases, suggesting that the viral enzyme has evolved to mimic VRK activity. Indeed, B1 and VRKs have been demonstrated to target a shared substrate, the DNA binding protein BAF, elucidating a signaling pathway important for both mitosis and the antiviral response. In this study, we further characterize the role of B1 during vaccinia infection to gain novel insights into its regulation and integration with cellular signaling pathways. We begin by describing the construction and characterization of the first B1 deletion virus (vv Delta B1) produced using a complementing cell line expressing the viral kinase. Examination of vv Delta B1 revealed that B1 is critical for the production of infectious virions in various cell types and is sufficient for BAF phosphorylation. Interestingly, the severity of the defect in DNA replication following the loss of B1 varied between cell types, leading us to posit that cellular VRKs partly complement for the absence of B1 in some cell lines. Using cell lines devoid of either VRK1 or VRK2, we tested this hypothesis and discovered that VRK2 expression facilitates DNA replication and allows later stages of the viral life cycle to proceed in the absence of B1. Finally, we present evidence that the impact of VRK2 on vaccinia virus is largely independent of BAF phosphorylation. These data support a model in which B1 and VRK2 share additional substrates important for the replication of cytoplasmic poxviruses.
   IMPORTANCE Viral mimicry of cellular signaling modulators provides clear evidence that the pathogen targets an important host pathway during infection. Poxviruses employ numerous viral homologs of cellular proteins, the study of which have yielded insights into signaling pathways used by both virus and cells alike. The vaccinia virus B1 protein is a homolog of cellular vaccinia virus-related kinases (VRKs) and is needed for viral DNA replication and likely other stages of the viral life cycle. However, much remains to be learned about how B1 and VRKs overlap functionally. This study utilizes new tools, including a B1 deletion virus and VRK knockout cells, to further characterize the functional links between the viral and cellular enzymes. As a result, we have discovered that B1 and VRK2 target a common set of substrates vital to productive infection of this large cytoplasmic DNA virus.

TI Influenza A Virus NS1 Protein Promotes Efficient Nuclear Export of
   Unspliced Viral M1 mRNA

   TRANSCRIPTION; TEMPERATURE; GENE; TRANSLATION; COMPLEX
AB Influenza A virus mRNAs are transcribed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the cell nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Segment 7 produces two major transcripts: an unspliced mRNA that encodes the M1 matrix protein and a spliced transcript that encodes the M2 ion channel. Export of both mRNAs is dependent on the cellular NXF1/TAP pathway, but it is unclear how they are recruited to the export machinery or how the introncontaining but unspliced M1 mRNA bypasses the normal quality-control checkpoints. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization to monitor segment 7 mRNA localization, we found that cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced M1 mRNA was inefficient in the absence of NS1, both in the context of segment 7 RNPs reconstituted by plasmid transfection and in mutant virus-infected cells. This effect was independent of any major effect on steady-state levels of segment 7 mRNA or splicing but corresponded to a similar to 5-fold reduction in the accumulation of M1. A similar defect in intronless hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA nuclear export was seen with an NS1 mutant virus. Efficient export of M1 mRNA required both an intact NS1 RNA-binding domain and effector domain. Furthermore, while wild-type NS1 interacted with cellular NXF1 and also increased the interaction of segment 7 mRNA with NXF1, mutant NS1 polypeptides unable to promote mRNA export did neither. Thus, we propose that NS1 facilitates late viral gene expression by acting as an adaptor between viral mRNAs and the cellular nuclear export machinery to promote their nuclear export.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus is a major pathogen of a wide variety of mammalian and avian species that threatens public health and food security. A fuller understanding of the virus life cycle is important to aid control strategies. The virus has a small genome that encodes relatively few proteins that are often multifunctional. Here, we characterize a new function for the NS1 protein, showing that, as well as previously identified roles in antagonizing the innate immune defenses of the cell and directly upregulating translation of viral mRNAs, it also promotes the nuclear export of the viral late gene mRNAs by acting as an adaptor between the viral mRNAs and the cellular mRNA nuclear export machinery.

AB Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is an oncolytic RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Its nucleotide sequence is highly similar to those of members of the Cardiovirus genus. SVV is also a neuroendocrine cancer-selective oncolytic picornavirus that can be used for anticancer therapy. However, the interaction between SVV and its host is yet to be fully characterized. In this study, SVV inhibited antiviral type I interferon (IFN) responses by targeting different host adaptors, including mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), Toll/interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF), and TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa B activator (TANK), via viral 3C protease (3C(pro)). SVV 3C(pro) mediated the cleavage of MAVS, TRIF, and TANK at specific sites, which required its protease activity. The cleaved MAVS, TRIF, and TANK lost the ability to regulate pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated IFN production. The cleavage of TANK also facilitated TRAF6-induced NF-kappa B activation. SVV was also found to be sensitive to IFN-beta. Therefore, SVV suppressed antiviral IFN production to escape host antiviral innate immune responses by cleaving host adaptor molecules.
   IMPORTANCE Host cells have developed various defenses against microbial pathogen infection. The production of IFN is the first line of defense against microbial infection. However, viruses have evolved many strategies to disrupt this host defense. SVV, a member of the Picornavirus genus, is an oncolytic virus that shows potential functions in anticancer therapy. It has been demonstrated that IFN can be used in anticancer therapy for certain tumors. However, the relationship between oncolytic virus and innate immune response in anticancer therapy is still not well known. In this study, we showed that SVV has evolved as an effective mechanism to inhibit host type I IFN production by using its 3Cpro to cleave the molecules MAVS, TRIF, and TANK directly. These molecules are crucial for the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)mediated and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)-mediated signaling pathway. We also found that SVV is sensitive to IFN-beta. These findings increase our understanding of the interaction between SVV and host innate immunity.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3D(pol)) catalyzes viral RNA synthesis. Its characteristic low fidelity and absence of proofreading activity allow FMDV to rapidly mutate and adapt to dynamic environments. In this study, we used the structure of FMDV 3D(pol) in combination with previously reported results from similar picornaviral polymerases to design point mutations that would alter replication fidelity. In particular, we targeted Trp237 within conserved polymerase motif A because of the low reversion potential inherent in the single UGG codon. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we show that the replacement of tryptophan 237 with phenylalanine imparts higher fidelity, but replacements with isoleucine and leucine resulted in lower-fidelity phenotypes. Viruses containing these W237 substitutions show in vitro growth kinetics and plaque morphologies similar to those of the wild-type (WT) A(24) Cruzeiro strain in BHK cells, and both high-and low-fidelity variants retained fitness during coinfection with the wildtype virus. The higher-fidelity W237F (W237F(HF)) mutant virus was more resistant to the mutagenic nucleoside analogs ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil than the WT virus, whereas the lower-fidelity W237I (W237I(LF)) and W237L(LF) mutant viruses exhibited lower ribavirin resistance. Interestingly, the variant viruses showed heterogeneous and slightly delayed growth kinetics in primary porcine kidney cells, and they were significantly attenuated in mouse infection experiments. These data demonstrate, for a single virus, that either increased or decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates virus growth in animals, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer and genetically more stable vaccine candidates.
   IMPORTANCE Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most devastating disease affecting livestock worldwide. Here, using structural and biochemical analyses, we have identified FMDV 3D(pol) mutations that affect polymerase fidelity. Recombinant FMDVs containing substitutions at 3D(pol) tryptophan residue 237 were genetically stable and displayed plaque phenotypes and growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture. We further demonstrate that viruses harboring either a W237F(HF) substitution or W237I(LF) and W237L(LF) mutations were highly attenuated in animals. Our study shows that obtaining 3D(pol) fidelity variants by protein engineering based on polymerase structure and function could be exploited for the development of attenuated FMDV vaccine candidates that are safer and more stable than strains obtained by selective pressure via mutagenic nucleotides or adaptation approaches.

AB Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an oncolytic virus being developed for the treatment of cancer. Following infection of a human ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR3) with a recombinant low-pathogenic NDV, persistent infection was established in a subset of tumor cells. Persistently infected (PI) cells exhibited resistance to superinfection with NDV and established an antiviral state, as demonstrated by upregulation of interferon and interferon-induced genes such as myxoma resistance gene 1 (Mx1) and retinoic acid-inducing gene-I (RIG-I). Viruses released from PI cells induced higher cell-to-cell fusion than the parental virus following infection in two tumor cell lines tested, HT1080 and HeLa, and remained attenuated in chickens. Two mutations, one in the fusion (F) protein cleavage site, F117S (F117S), and another in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), G169R (HN169R), located in the second sialic acid binding region, were responsible for the hyperfusogenic phenotype. F117S improves F protein cleavage efficiency, facilitating cell-to-cell fusion, while HN169R possesses a multifaceted role in contributing to higher fusion, reduced receptor binding, and lower neuraminidase activity, which together result in increased fusion and reduced viral replication. Thus, establishment of persistent infection in vitro involves viral genetic changes that facilitate efficient viral spread from cell to cell as a potential mechanism to escape host antiviral responses. The results of our study also demonstrate a critical role in the viral life cycle for the second receptor binding region of the HN protein, which is conserved in several paramyxoviruses.

AB Understanding the diversity and consequences of viruses present in honey bees is critical for maintaining pollinator health and managing the spread of disease. The viral landscape of honey bees (Apis mellifera) has changed dramatically since the emergence of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which increased the spread of virulent variants of viruses such as deformed wing virus. Previous genomic studies have focused on colonies suffering from infections by Varroa and virulent viruses, which could mask other viral species present in honey bees, resulting in a distorted view of viral diversity. To capture the viral diversity within colonies that are exposed to mites but do not suffer the ultimate consequences of the infestation, we examined populations of honey bees that have evolved naturally or have been selected for resistance to Varroa. This analysis revealed seven novel viruses isolated from honey bees sampled globally, including the first identification of negative-sense RNA viruses in honey bees. Notably, two rhabdovi-ruses were present in three geographically diverse locations and were also present in Varroa mites parasitizing the bees. To characterize the antiviral response, we performed deep sequencing of small RNA populations in honey bees and mites. This provided evidence of a Dicer-mediated immune response in honey bees, while the viral small RNA profile in Varroa mites was novel and distinct from the response observed in bees. Overall, we show that viral diversity in honey bee colonies is greater than previously thought, which encourages additional studies of the bee virome on a global scale and which may ultimately improve disease management.
   IMPORTANCE Honey bee populations have become increasingly susceptible to colony losses due to pathogenic viruses spread by parasitic Varroa mites. To date, 24 viruses have been described in honey bees, with most belonging to the order Picornavirales. Collapsing Varroa-infected colonies are often overwhelmed with high levels of picornaviruses. To examine the underlying viral diversity in honey bees, we employed viral metatranscriptomics analyses on three geographically diverse Varroa-resistant populations from Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. We describe seven novel viruses from a range of diverse viral families, including two viruses that are present in all three locations. In honey bees, small RNA sequences indicate that these viruses are processed by Dicer and the RNA interference pathway, whereas Varroa mites produce strikingly novel small RNA patterns. This work increases the number and diversity of known honey bee viruses and will ultimately contribute to improved disease management in our most important agricultural pollinator.

TI Reducing V3 Antigenicity and Immunogenicity on Soluble, Native-Like
   HIV-1 Env SOSIP Trimers

AB Native-like trimers of the SOSIP design are being developed as immunogens in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine development programs. These trimers display the epitopes for multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) but can also expose binding sites for some types of nonneutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs). Among the latter are epitopes in the gp120 V3 region that are highly immunogenic when SOSIP trimers are evaluated in animal models. It is presently uncertain whether antibodies against V3 can interfere with the induction of NAbs, but there are good arguments in favor of suppressing such "off-target" immune responses. Accordingly, we have assessed how to minimize the exposure of V3 non-NAb epitopes and thereby reduce their immunogenicity by introducing N-glycans within the V3 region of BG505 SOSIP trimers. We found that inserting glycans at positions 306 and 314 (termed M1 and M7) markedly reduced V3 antigenicity while improving the presentation of trimer apex bNAb epitopes. Both added glycans were shown to be predominantly of the Man(6)GlcNAc(2) form. The additional introduction of the E64K ground-state stabilizing substitution markedly reduced or ablated soluble CD4 (sCD4) induction of non-NAb epitopes in V3 and/or associated with the coreceptor binding site. When a V3 glycan-and E64K-modified trimer variant, BG505 SOSIP. 664-E64K.M1M7, was tested in rabbits, V3 immunogenicity was eliminated while the autologous NAb response was unchanged.
   IMPORTANCE Trimeric proteins are being developed for future HIV-1 vaccine trials in humans, with the goal of eliciting broadly active neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that are active against a wide variety of circulating strains. In animal models, the present generation of native-like trimer immunogens, exemplified by the BG505 SOSIP. 664 construct, induces narrow-specificity antibodies against the neutralization-resistant (tier-2), sequence-matched virus and more broadly active antibodies against sequence-divergent atypically neutralization-sensitive (tier-1) viruses. A concern in the trimer immunogen design field has been whether the latter off-target antibodies might interfere with the induction of the more desired responses to tier-2 epitopes. Here, we have inserted two glycans into the dominant site for tier-1 NAbs, the gp120 V3 region, to block the induction of off-target antibodies. We characterized the new trimers, tested them as immunogens in rabbits, and found that the blocking glycans eliminated the induction of tier-1 NAbs to V3-epitopes.

ID FUSION; REQUIRES
AB Ebolaviruses have a surface glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) that is required for virus attachment and entry into cells. Mutations affecting GP(1,2) functions can alter virus growth properties. We generated a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding Ebola virus Makona variant GP(1,2) (rVSV-MAK-GP) and observed emergence of a T544I mutation in the Makona GP(1,2) gene during tissue culture passage in certain cell lines. The T544I mutation emerged within two passages when VSV-MAK-GP was grown on Vero E6, Vero, and BS-C-1 cells but not when it was passaged on Huh7 and HepG2 cells. The mutation led to a marked increase in virus growth kinetics and conferred a robust growth advantage over wild-type rVSV-MAK-GP on Vero E6 cells. Analysis of complete viral genomes collected from patients in western Africa indicated that this mutation was not found in Ebola virus clinical samples. However, we observed the emergence of T544I during serial passage of various Ebola Makona isolates on Vero E6 cells. Three independent isolates showed emergence of T544I from undetectable levels in nonpassaged virus or virus passaged once to frequencies of greater than 60% within a single passage, consistent with it being a tissue culture adaptation. Intriguingly, T544I is not found in any Sudan, Bundibugyo, or Tai Forest ebolavirus sequences. Furthermore, T544I did not emerge when we serially passaged recombinant VSV encoding GP(1,2) from these ebolaviruses. This report provides experimental evidence that the spontaneous mutation T544I is a tissue culture adaptation in certain cell lines and that it may be unique for the species Zaire ebolavirus.
   IMPORTANCE The Ebola virus (Zaire) species is the most lethal species of all ebolaviruses in terms of mortality rate and number of deaths. Understanding how the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein functions to facilitate entry in cells is an area of intense research. Recently, three groups independently identified a polymorphism in the Ebola glycoprotein (I544) that enhanced virus entry, but they did not agree in their conclusions regarding its impact on pathogenesis. Our findings here address the origins of this polymorphism and provide experimental evidence showing that it is the result of a spontaneous mutation (T544I) specific to tissue culture conditions, suggesting that it has no role in pathogenesis. We further show that this mutation may be unique to the species Zaire ebolavirus, as it does not occur in Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Tai Forest ebolaviruses. Understanding the mechanism behind this mutation can provide insight into functional differences that exist in culture conditions and among ebolavirus glycoproteins.

   IDENTIFICATION; VIRUS
AB Inclusion body disease (IBD) is an infectious disease originally described in captive snakes. It has traditionally been diagnosed by the presence of large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions and is associated with neurological, gastrointestinal, and lymphoproliferative disorders. Previously, we identified and established a culture system for a novel lineage of arenaviruses isolated from boa constrictors diagnosed with IBD. Although ample circumstantial evidence suggested that these viruses, now known as reptarenaviruses, cause IBD, there has been no formal demonstration of disease causality since their discovery. We therefore conducted a long-term challenge experiment to test the hypothesis that reptarenaviruses cause IBD. We infected boa constrictors and ball pythons by cardiac injection of purified virus. We monitored the progression of viral growth in tissues, blood, and environmental samples. Infection produced dramatically different disease outcomes in snakes of the two species. Ball pythons infected with Golden Gate virus (GoGV) and with another reptarenavirus displayed severe neurological signs within 2 months, and viral replication was detected only in central nervous system tissues. In contrast, GoGV-infected boa constrictors remained free of clinical signs for 2 years, despite high viral loads and the accumulation of large intracellular inclusions in multiple tissues, including the brain. Inflammation was associated with infection in ball pythons but not in boa constrictors. Thus, reptarenavirus infection produces inclusions and inclusion body disease, although inclusions per se are neither necessarily associated with nor required for disease. Although the natural distribution of reptarenaviruses has yet to be described, the different outcomes of infection may reflect differences in geographical origin.
   IMPORTANCE New DNA sequencing technologies have made it easier than ever to identify the sequences of microorganisms in diseased tissues, i.e., to identify organisms that appear to cause disease, but to be certain that a candidate pathogen actually causes disease, it is necessary to provide additional evidence of causality. We have done this to demonstrate that reptarenaviruses cause inclusion body disease (IBD), a serious transmissible disease of snakes. We infected boa constrictors and ball pythons with purified reptarenavirus. Ball pythons fell ill within 2 months of infection and displayed signs of neurological disease typical of IBD. In contrast, boa constrictors remained healthy over 2 years, despite high levels of virus throughout their bodies. This difference matches previous reports that pythons are more susceptible to IBD than boas and could reflect the possibility that boas are natural hosts of these viruses in the wild.

AB Endogenous viral elements derived from nonretroviral RNA viruses have been described in various animal genomes. Whether they have a biological function, such as host immune protection against related viruses, is a field of intense study. Here, we investigated the repertoire of endogenous flaviviral elements (EFVEs) in Aedes mosquitoes, the vectors of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses. Previous studies identified three EFVEs from Aedes albopictus cell lines and one from Aedes aegypti cell lines. However, an in-depth characterization of EFVEs in wild-type mosquito populations and individual mosquitoes in vivo has not been performed. We detected the full-length DNA sequence of the previously described EFVEs and their respective transcripts in several A. albopictus and A. aegypti populations from geographically distinct areas. However, EFVE-derived proteins were not detected by mass spectrometry. Using deep sequencing, we detected the production of PIWI-interacting RNA-like small RNAs, in an antisense orientation, targeting the EFVEs and their flanking regions in vivo. The EFVEs were integrated in repetitive regions of the mosquito genomes, and their flanking sequences varied among mosquito populations. We bioinformatically predicted several new EFVEs from a Vietnamese A. albopictus population and observed variation in the occurrence of those elements among mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of an A. aegypti EFVE suggested that it integrated prior to the global expansion of the species and subsequently diverged among and within populations. The findings of this study together reveal the substantial structural and nucleotide diversity of flaviviral integrations in Aedes genomes. Unraveling this diversity will help to elucidate the potential biological function of these EFVEs.
   IMPORTANCE Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are whole or partial viral sequences integrated in host genomes. Interestingly, some EVEs have important functions for host fitness and antiviral defense. Because mosquitoes also have EVEs in their genomes, characterizing these EVEs is a prerequisite for their potential use to manipulate the mosquito antiviral response. In the study described here, we focused on EVEs related to the Flavivirus genus, to which dengue and Zika viruses belong, in individual Aedes mosquitoes from geographically distinct areas. We show the existence in vivo of flaviviral EVEs previously identified in mosquito cell lines, and we detected new ones. We show that EVEs have evolved differently in each mosquito population. They produce transcripts and small RNAs but not proteins, suggesting a function at the RNA level. Our study uncovers the diverse repertoire of flaviviral EVEs in Aedes mosquito populations and contributes to an understanding of their role in the host antiviral system.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exists as a lipoprotein-virus hybrid lipoviroparticle (LVP). In vitro studies have demonstrated the importance of apolipoproteins in HCV secretion and infectivity, leading to the notion that HCV coopts the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) for its egress. However, the mechanisms involved in virus particle assembly and egress are still elusive. The biogenesis of VLDL particles occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by subsequent lipidation in the ER and Golgi compartment. The secretion of mature VLDL particles occurs through the Golgi secretory pathway. HCV virions are believed to latch onto or fuse with the nascent VLDL particle in either the ER or the Golgi compartment, resulting in the generation of LVPs. In our attempt to unravel the collaboration between HCV and VLDL secretion, we studied HCV particles budding from the ER en route to the Golgi compartment in COPII vesicles. Biophysical characterization of COPII vesicles fractionated on an iodixanol gradient revealed that HCV RNA is enriched in the highly buoyant COPII vesicle fractions and cofractionates with apolipoprotein B (ApoB), ApoE, and the HCV core and envelope proteins. Electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled microsections revealed that the HCV envelope and core proteins colocalize with apolipoproteins and HCV RNA in Sec31-coated COPII vesicles. Ultrastructural analysis also revealed the presence of HCV structural proteins, RNA, and apolipoproteins in the Golgi stacks. These findings support the hypothesis that HCV LVPs assemble in the ER and are transported to the Golgi compartment in COPII vesicles to embark on the Golgi secretory route.
   IMPORTANCE HCV assembly and release accompany the formation of LVPs that circulate in the sera of HCV patients and are also produced in an in vitro culture system. The pathway of HCV morphogenesis and secretion has not been fully understood. This study investigates the exact site where the association of HCV virions with host lipoproteins occurs. Using immunoprecipitation of COPII vesicles and immuno-gold electron microscopy (EM), we characterize the existence of LVPs that co-fractionate with lipoproteins, viral proteins, RNA, and vesicular components. Our results show that this assembly occurs in the ER, and LVPs thus formed are carried through the Golgi network by vesicular transport. This work provides a unique insight into the HCV LVP assembly process within infected cells and offers opportunities for designing antiviral therapeutic cellular targets.

AB Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem. Although the currently approved medications can reliably reduce the viral load and prevent the progression of liver diseases, they fail to cure the viral infection. In an effort toward discovery of novel antiviral agents against HBV, a group of benzamide (BA) derivatives that significantly reduced the amount of cytoplasmic HBV DNA were discovered. The initial lead optimization efforts identified two BA derivatives with improved antiviral activity for further mechanistic studies. Interestingly, similar to our previously reported sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), the BAs promote the formation of empty capsids through specific interaction with HBV core protein but not other viral and host cellular components. Genetic evidence suggested that both SBAs and BAs inhibited HBV nucleocapsid assembly by binding to the heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) pocket between core protein dimer-dimer interfaces. However, unlike SBAs, BA compounds uniquely induced the formation of empty capsids that migrated more slowly in native agarose gel electrophoresis from A36V mutant than from the wild-type core protein. Moreover, we showed that the assembly of chimeric capsids from wild-type and drug-resistant core proteins was susceptible to multiple capsid assembly modulators. Hence, HBV core protein is a dominant antiviral target that may suppress the selection of drug-resistant viruses during core protein-targeting antiviral therapy. Our studies thus indicate that BAs are a chemically and mechanistically unique type of HBV capsid assembly modulators and warranted for further development as antiviral agents against HBV.
   IMPORTANCE HBV core protein plays essential roles in many steps of the viral replication cycle. In addition to packaging viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and DNA polymerase complex into nucleocapsids for reverse transcriptional DNA replication to take place, the core protein dimers, existing in several different quaternary structures in infected hepatocytes, participate in and regulate HBV virion assembly, capsid uncoating, and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation. It is anticipated that small molecular core protein assembly modulators may disrupt one or multiple steps of HBV replication, depending on their interaction with the distinct quaternary structures of core protein. The discovery of novel core protein-targeting antivirals, such as benzamide derivatives reported here, and investigation of their antiviral mechanism may lead to the identification of antiviral therapeutics for the cure of chronic hepatitis B.

AB N-6-adenosine methylation (m(6)A) is the most common posttranscriptional RNA modification in mammalian cells. We found that most transcripts encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genome undergo m6A modification. The levels of m(6)A-modified mRNAs increased substantially upon stimulation for lytic replication. The blockage of m(6)A inhibited splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the replication transcription activator (RTA), a key KSHV lytic switch protein, and halted viral lytic replication. We identified several m(6)A sites in RTA pre-mRNA crucial for splicing through interactions with YTH domain containing 1 (YTHDC1), an m6A nuclear reader protein, in conjunction with serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) and SRSF10. Interestingly, RTA induced m(6)A and enhanced its own pre-mRNA splicing. Our results not only demonstrate an essential role of m(6)A in regulating RTA pre-mRNA splicing but also suggest that KSHV has evolved a mechanism to manipulate the host m(6)A machinery to its advantage in promoting lytic replication.
   IMPORTANCE KSHV productive lytic replication plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of Kaposi's sarcoma tumors. Previous studies suggested that the KSHV switch from latency to lytic replication is primarily controlled at the chromatin level through histone and DNA modifications. The present work reports for the first time that KSHV genome-encoded mRNAs undergo m(6)A modification, which represents a new mechanism at the posttranscriptional level in the control of viral replication.

TI Discovery of a Prefusion Respiratory Syncytial Virus F-Specific
   Monoclonal Antibody That Provides Greater In Vivo Protection than the

AB Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection. However, its relatively low neutralizing potency and high cost have limited its use to a restricted population of infants at high risk of severe disease. Previously, we isolated a high-potency neutralizing antibody, 5C4, that specifically recognizes antigenic site empty set at the apex of the pre-F protein trimer. We compared in vitro and in vivo the potency and protective efficacy of 5C4 and the murine precursor of palivizumab, antibody 1129. Both antibodies were synthesized on identical murine backbones as either an IgG1 or IgG2a subclass and evaluated for binding to multiple F protein conformations, in vitro inhibition of RSV infection and propagation, and protective efficacy in mice. Although 1129 and 5C4 had similar pre-F protein binding affinities, the 5C4 neutralizing activity was nearly 50-fold greater than that of 1129 in vitro. In BALB/c mice, 5C4 reduced the peak titers of RSV 1,000-fold more than 1129 did in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data indicate that antibodies specific for antigenic site empty set are more efficacious at preventing RSV infection than antibodies specific for antigenic site II. Our data also suggest that site empty set-specific antibodies may be useful for the prevention or treatment of RSV infection and support the use of the pre-F protein as a vaccine antigen.
   IMPORTANCE There is no vaccine yet available to prevent RSV infection. The use of the licensed antibody palivizumab, which recognizes site II on both the pre-F and post-F proteins, is restricted to prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease. Recommendations for using passive immunization in the general population or for therapy in immunocompromised persons with persistent infection is limited because of cost, determined from the high doses needed to compensate for its relatively low neutralizing potency. Prior efforts to improve the in vitro potency of site II-specific antibodies did not translate to significant in vivo dose sparing. We isolated a pre-F protein-specific, high-potency neutralizing antibody (5C4) that recognizes antigenic site empty set and compared its efficacy to that of the murine precursor of palivizumab (antibody 1129) matched for isotype and pre-F protein binding affinities. Our findings demonstrate that epitope specificity is an important determinant of antibody neutralizing potency, and defining the mechanisms of neutralization has the potential to identify improved products for the prevention and treatment of RSV infection.

AB Autophagy is closely associated with the regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. HBV X protein (HBx), a multifunctional regulator in HBV-associated biological processes, has been demonstrated to be crucial for autophagy induction by HBV. However, the molecular mechanisms of autophagy induction by HBx, especially the signaling pathways involved, remain elusive. In the present investigation, we demonstrated that HBx induced autophagosome formation independently of the class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In contrast, the class III PI3K(VPS34)/beclin-1 pathway was revealed to be critical for HBx-induced autophagosome formation. Further study showed that HBx did not affect the level of VPS34 and beclin-1 expression but inhibited beclin-1/Bcl-2 association, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling was found to be important for this process. Moreover, it was found that HBx treatment led to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibition of ROS activity abrogated both JNK activation and autophagosome formation. Of importance, ROS-JNK signaling was also revealed to play an important role in HBV-induced autophagosome formation and subsequent HBV replication. These data may provide deeper insight into the mechanisms of autophagy induction by HBx and help in the design of new therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.

These data help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of autophagy induction by HBx/HBV and might be useful for designing novel therapeutic approaches to HBV infection.

AB Early sensing of viral components or infection-induced tissue damage is a prerequisite for the successful control of pathogenic viruses by the host innate immune system. Recent results from our laboratory show how immune cells use the DNA-sensing machinery to detect intracellular damage generated early during infection by an RNA virus, namely, dengue virus (DENV). Conversely, we found that DENV can efficiently dismantle this sensing mechanism by targeting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), two crucial host factors involved in DNA detection and type I IFN production. These findings highlight the relevance of the DNA-sensing mechanism in the detection and control of infections by RNA viruses. In this review, we discuss how DENV modulates the innate immune DNA-sensing pathway, activated in the context of cellular damage during infection.

AB The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif is essential for viral replication by counteracting the host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G), and balanced levels of both proteins are required for efficient viral replication. Noncoding exons 2/2b contain the Vif start codon between their alternatively used splice donors 2 and 2b (D2 and D2b). For vif mRNA, intron 1 must be removed while intron 2 must be retained. Thus, splice acceptor 1 (A1) must be activated by U1 snRNP binding to either D2 or D2b, while splicing at D2 or D2b must be prevented. Here, we unravel the complex interactions between previously known and novel components of the splicing regulatory network regulating HIV-1 exon 2/2b inclusion in viral mRNAs. In particular, using RNA pulldown experiments and mass spectrometry analysis, we found members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) A/B family binding to a novel splicing regulatory element (SRE), the exonic splicing silencer ESS2b, and the splicing regulatory proteins Tra2/SRSF10 binding to the nearby exonic splicing enhancer ESE2b. Using a minigene reporter, we performed bioinformatics HEXplorerguided mutational analysis to narrow down SRE motifs affecting splice site selection between D2 and D2b. Eventually, the impacts of these SREs on the viral splicing pattern and protein expression were exhaustively analyzed in viral particle production and replication experiments. Masking of these protein binding sites by use of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) impaired Vif expression and viral replication.
   IMPORTANCE Based on our results, we propose a model in which a dense network of SREs regulates vif mRNA and protein expression, crucial to maintain viral replication within host cells with varying A3G levels and at different stages of infection. This regulation is maintained by several serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSF) and hnRNPs binding to those elements. Targeting this cluster of SREs with LNAs may lead to the development of novel effective therapeutic strategies.

AB The maturation process of high-affinity antibodies is a result of intricate interactions between B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells occurring in lymphoid germinal centers. HIV infection induces significant chronic immune activation, phenotypic skewing, and inflammation driven by years of continuous viral replication. High levels of viremia as well as immune activation and dysfunction have been demonstrated to have a perturbing impact on the B cell memory compartment and contribute to B cell exhaustion. Counterintuitively, the factors associated with perturbation of the B cell compartment seem to be favorable for the generation of highly affinity-matured Env-specific antibodies in a minority of HIV-infected individuals. Thus, the impact of HIV antigenemia on B cells and Tfh cell interactions warrants further exploration. We therefore studied immunophenotypes of HIV-specific B cells in individuals with differing levels of viral control using HIV Env gp120 probes and characterized the functionality of matched T cells in peripheral blood. While CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells were significantly diminished in HIV progressors, we found that a small subset of gp 120-specific interleukin-21 (IL-21)-secreting CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells were significantly associated with gp120-specific B cell frequencies. In contrast, neither bulk CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells nor other HIV antigen specificities were associated with gp120-specific B cell levels. HIV-specific B cells derived from elite controllers displayed greater amounts of gp120-specific B cells in the resting memory subset, whereas HIV-specific B cells in progressors accumulated in tissue-like and activated memory subsets. Furthermore, CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells from elite controllers showed a stronger ex vivo capacity to induce B cell maturation and immunoglobulin class switching than cells from HIV progressors.
   IMPORTANCE Dissecting the factors that are involved in B cell maturation and antibody development is important for HIV vaccine design. In this study, we found that HIV Env- specific CXCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells that secrete interleukin-21 are strongly associated with B cell memory phenotypes and function. Moreover, we found that the immune responses of HIV controllers showed intrinsically better helper activity than those of HIV progressors.

AB Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes deadly illness in horses and humans. An intriguing feature of HeV is the utilization of endosomal protease for activation of the viral fusion protein (F). Here we investigated how endosomal F trafficking affects HeV assembly. We found that the HeV matrix (M) and F proteins each induced particle release when they were expressed alone but that their coexpression led to coordinated assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) that were morphologically and physically distinct from M-only or F-only VLPs. Mutations to the F protein transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail that disrupted endocytic trafficking led to failure of F to function with M for VLP assembly. Wild-type F functioned normally for VLP assembly even when its cleavage was prevented with a cathepsin inhibitor, indicating that it is endocytic F trafficking that is important for VLP assembly, not proteolytic F cleavage. Under specific conditions of reduced M expression, we found that M could no longer induce significant VLP release but retained the ability to be incorporated as a passenger into F-driven VLPs, provided that the F protein was competent for endocytic trafficking. The F and M proteins were both found to traffic through Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (REs), suggesting a model in which F and M trafficking pathways converge at REs, enabling these proteins to preassemble before arriving at plasma membrane budding sites.
   IMPORTANCE Hendra virus and Nipah virus are zoonotic paramyxoviruses that cause lethal infections in humans. Unlike that for most paramyxoviruses, activation of the henipavirus fusion protein occurs in recycling endosomal compartments. In this study, we demonstrate that the unique endocytic trafficking pathway of Hendra virus F protein is required for proper viral assembly and particle release. These results advance our basic understanding of the henipavirus assembly process and provide a novel model for the interplay between glycoprotein trafficking and paramyxovirus assembly.

AB Dengue is an acute febrile illness caused by dengue virus (DENV) and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The lack of an appropriate small-animal model of dengue infection has greatly hindered the study of dengue pathogenesis and the development of therapeutics. In this study, we conducted mass spectrometry-based serum metabolic profiling from a model using humanized mice (humice) with DENV serotype 2 infection at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days postinfection (dpi). Forty-eight differential metabolites were identified, including fatty acids, purines and pyrimidines, acylcarnitines, acylglycines, phospholipids, sphingolipids, amino acids and derivatives, free fatty acids, and bile acid. These metabolites showed a reversible-change trend-most were significantly perturbed at 3 or 7 dpi and returned to control levels at 14 or 28 dpi, indicating that the metabolites might serve as prognostic markers of the disease in humice. The major perturbed metabolic pathways included purine and pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, lysine biosynthesis and degradation, and bile acid biosynthesis. Most of these disturbed pathways are similar to our previous metabolomics findings in a longitudinal cohort of adult human dengue patients across different infection stages. Our analyses revealed the commonalities of host responses to DENV infection between humice and humans and suggested that humice could be a useful small-animal model for the study of dengue pathogenesis and the development of dengue therapeutics.
   IMPORTANCE Dengue virus is the most widespread arbovirus, causing an estimated 390 million dengue infections worldwide every year. There is currently no effective treatment for the disease, and the lack of an appropriate small-animal model of dengue infection has greatly increased the challenges in the study of dengue pathogenesis and the development of therapeutics. Metabolomics provides global views of small-molecule metabolites and is a useful tool for finding metabolic pathways related to disease processes. Here, we conducted a serum metabolomics study on a model using humanized mice with dengue infection that had significant levels of human platelets, monocytes/macrophages, and hepatocytes. Forty-eight differential metabolites were identified, and the underlying perturbed metabolic pathways are quite similar to the pathways found to be altered in dengue patients in previous metabolomics studies, indicating that humanized mice could be a highly relevant small-animal model for the study of dengue pathogenesis and the development of dengue therapeutics.

AB Vilyuisk human encephalitis virus (VHEV) is a picornavirus related to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). VHEV was isolated from human material passaged in mice. Whether this VHEV is of human or mouse origin is therefore unclear. We took advantage of the species-specific activity of the nonstructural L* protein of theiloviruses to track the origin of TMEV isolates. TMEV L* inhibits RNase L, the effector enzyme of the interferon pathway. By using coimmunoprecipitation and functional RNase L assays, the species specificity of RNase L antagonism was tested for L* from mouse (DA) and rat (RTV-1) TMEV strains as well as for VHEV. Coimmunoprecipitation and functional assay data confirmed the species specificity of L* activity and showed that L* from rat strain RTV-1 inhibited rat but not mouse or human RNase L. Next, we showed that the VHEV L* protein was phylogenetically related to L* of mouse viruses and that it failed to inhibit human RNase L but readily antagonized mouse RNase L, unambiguously showing the mouse origin of VHEV.
   IMPORTANCE Defining the natural host of a virus can be a thorny issue, especially when the virus was isolated only once or when the isolation story is complex. The species Theilovirus includes Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), infecting mice and rats, and Saffold virus (SAFV), infecting humans. One TMEV strain, Vilyuisk human encephalitis virus (VHEV), however, was isolated from mice that were inoculated with cerebrospinal fluid of a patient presenting with chronic encephalitis. It is therefore unclear whether VHEV was derived from the human sample or from the inoculated mouse. The L* protein encoded by TMEV inhibits RNase L, a cellular enzyme involved in innate immunity, in a species-specific manner. Using binding and functional assays, we show that this species specificity even allows discrimination between TMEV strains of mouse and of rat origins. The VHEV L* protein clearly inhibited mouse but not human RNase L, indicating that this virus originates from mice.

AB Despite the introduction of effective drugs to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a vaccine would be the only means to substantially reduce the worldwide disease burden. An incomplete understanding of how HCV interacts with its human host and evades immune surveillance has hampered vaccine development. It is generally accepted that in infected individuals, a narrow repertoire of exhausted T cells is a hallmark of persistent infection, whereas broad, vigorous CD4(+) and CD8 (+) T cell responses are associated with control of acute hepatitis C. We employed a vaccine approach based on a mixture of peptides (pepmix) spanning the entire sequence of HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) in cross-priming cationic liposomes (CAF09) to facilitate a versatile presentation of all possible T cell epitopes, regardless of the HLA background of the vaccine recipient. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination of mice with NS3 pepmix broadens the repertoire of epitopespecific T cells compared to the corresponding recombinant protein (rNS3). Moreover, vaccination with rNS3 induced only CD4 (+) T cells, whereas the NS3 pepmix induced a far more vigorous CD4 (+) T cell response and was as potent a CD8 (+) T cell inducer as an adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing NS3. Importantly, the cellular responses are dominated by multifunctional T cells, such as gamma interferonpositive (IFN-alpha (+)) tumor necrosis factor alpha-positive (TNF-alpha(+)) coproducers, and displayed cytotoxic capacity in mice. In conclusion, we present a novel vaccine approach against HCV, inducing a broadened T cell response targeting both immunodominant and potential subdominant epitopes, which may be key elements to counter T cell exhaustion and prevent chronicity.
   IMPORTANCE With at least 700,000 annual deaths, development of a vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has high priority, but the tremendous ability of the virus to dodge the human immune system poses great challenges. Furthermore, many chronic infections, including HCV infection, have a remarkable ability to drive initially strong CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cell responses against dominant epitopes toward an exhausted, dysfunctional state. Thus, new and innovative vaccine approaches to control HCV should be evaluated. Here, we report on a novel peptide-based nanoparticle vaccine strategy (NS3 pepmix) aimed at generating T cell immunity against potential subdominant T cell epitopes that are not efficiently targeted by vaccination with full-length recombinant protein (rNS3) or infection with HCV. As proof of concept, we found that NS3 pepmix excels in broadening the repertoire of epitope-specific, multifunctional, and cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to vaccination with rNS3, which generated only CD4 T+ cell responses.

AB Central nervous system infection of neonatal and adult rats with Borna disease virus (BDV) results in neuronal destruction and behavioral abnormalities with differential immune-mediated involvement. Neuroactive metabolites generated from the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation have been implicated in several human neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report that brain expression of key enzymes in the kynurenine pathway are significantly, but differentially, altered in neonatal and adult rats with BDV infection. Gene expression analysis of rat brains following neonatal infection showed increased expression of kynurenine amino transferase II (KATII) and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) enzymes. Additionally, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression was only modestly increased in a brain region- and time-dependent manner in neonatally infected rats; however, its expression was highly increased in adult infected rats. The most dramatic impact on gene expression was seen for KMO, whose activity promotes the production of neurotoxic quinolinic acid. KMO expression was persistently elevated in brain regions of both newborn and adult BDV-infected rats, with increases reaching up to 86-fold. KMO protein levels were increased in neonatally infected rats and colocalized with neurons, the primary target cells of BDV infection. Furthermore, quinolinic acid was elevated in neonatally infected rat brains. We further demonstrate increased expression of KATII and KMO, but not IDO, in vitro in BDV-infected C6 astroglioma cells. Our results suggest that BDV directly impacts the kynurenine pathway, an effect that may be exacerbated by inflammatory responses in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, experimental models of BDV infection may provide new tools for discriminating virusmediated from immune-mediated impacts on the kynurenine pathway and their relative contribution to neurodegeneration.
   IMPORTANCE BDV causes persistent, noncytopathic infection in vitro yet still elicits widespread neurodegeneration of infected neurons in both immunoincompetent and immunocompetent hosts. Here, we show that BDV infection induces expression of key enzymes of the kynurenine pathway in brains of newborn and adult infected rats and cultured astroglioma cells, shunting tryptophan degradation toward the production of neurotoxic quinolinic acid. Thus, our findings newly implicate this metabolic pathway in BDV-induced neurodegeneration. Given the importance of the kynurenine pathway in a wide range of human infections and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, animal models of BDV infection may serve as important tools for contrasting direct viral and indirect antiviral immune-mediated impacts on kynure-nine pathway dysregulation and the ensuing neurodevelopmental and neuropathological consequences.

AB Mammarenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bisegmented negativestranded RNA genome that encodes the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC), the RNA polymerase (L), and a RING matrix protein (Z). Viral proteins are synthesized from subgenomic mRNAs bearing a capped 5' untranslated region (UTR) and lacking 3' poly(A) tail. We analyzed the translation strategy of Tacaribe virus (TCRV), a prototype of the New World mammarenaviruses. A virus-like transcript that carries a reporter gene in place of the NP open reading frame and transcripts bearing modified 5' and/or 3' UTR were evaluated in a cellbased translation assay. We found that the presence of the cap structure at the 5' end dramatically increases translation efficiency and that the viral 5' UTR comprises stimulatory signals while the 3' UTR, specifically the presence of a terminal C + G-rich sequence and/or a stem-loop structure, down-modulates translation. Additionally, translation was profoundly reduced in eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G-inactivated cells, whereas depletion of intracellular levels of eIF4E had less impact on virus-like mRNA translation than on a cell-like transcript. Translation efficiency was independent of NP expression or TCRV infection. Our results indicate that TCRV mRNAs are translated using a cap-dependent mechanism, whose efficiency relies on the interplay between stimulatory signals in the 5' UTR and a negative modulatory element in the 3' UTR. The low dependence on eIF4E suggests that viral mRNAs may engage yet-unknown noncanonical host factors for a cap-dependent initiation mechanism. IMPORTANCE Several members of the Arenaviridae family cause serious hemorrhagic fevers in humans. In the present report, we describe the mechanism by which Tacaribe virus, a prototypic nonpathogenic New World mammarenavirus, regulates viral mRNA translation. Our results highlight the impact of untranslated sequences and key host translation factors on this process. We propose a model that explains how viral mRNAs outcompete cellular mRNAs for the translation machinery. A better understanding of the mechanism of translation regulation of this virus can provide the bases for the rational design of new antiviral tools directed to pathogenic arenaviruses.

AB Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a representative member of the New World alphaviruses. It is pathogenic for a variety of vertebrate hosts, in which EEEV induces a highly debilitating disease, and the outcomes are frequently lethal. Despite a significant public health threat, the molecular mechanism of EEEV replication and interaction with hosts is poorly understood. Our previously published data and those of other teams have demonstrated that hypervariable domains (HVDs) of the alphavirus nsP3 protein interact with virus-specific host factors and play critical roles in assembly of viral replication complexes (vRCs). The most abundantly represented HVD-binding proteins are the FXR and G3BP family members. FXR proteins drive the assembly of vRCs of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and G3BPs were shown to function in vRC assembly in the replication of chikungunya and Sindbis viruses. Our new study demonstrates that EEEV exhibits a unique level of redundancy in the use of host factors in RNA replication. EEEV efficiently utilizes both the VEEV-specific FXR protein family and the Old World alphavirusspecific G3BP protein family. A lack of interaction with either FXRs or G3BPs does not affect vRC formation; however, removal of EEEV's ability to interact with both protein families has a deleterious effect on virus growth. Other identified EEEV nsP3 HVDinteracting host proteins are also capable of supporting EEEV replication, albeit with a dramatically lower efficiency. The ability to use a wide range of host factors with redundant functions in vRC assembly and function provides a plausible explanation for the efficient replication of EEEV and may contribute to its highly pathogenic phenotype.
   IMPORTANCE Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is one of the most pathogenic New World alphaviruses. Despite the continuous public health threat, to date, the molecular mechanisms of its very efficient replication and high virulence are not sufficiently understood. The results of this new study demonstrate that North American EEEV exhibits a high level of redundancy in using host factors in replication complex assembly and virus replication. The hypervariable domain of the EEEV nsP3 protein interacts with all of the members of the FXR and G3BP protein families, and only a lack of interaction with both protein families strongly affects virus replication rates. Other identified HVD-binding factors are also involved in EEEV replication, but their roles are not as critical as those of FXRs and G3BPs. The new data present a plausible explanation for the exceptionally high replication rates of EEEV and suggest a new means of its attenuation and new targets for screening of antiviral drugs.

AB Replication of minute virus of mice (MVM) induces a sustained cellular DNA damage response (DDR) which the virus then exploits to prepare the nuclear environment for effective parvovirus takeover. An essential aspect of the MVMinduced DDR is the establishment of a potent premitotic block, which we previously found to be independent of activated p21 and ATR/Chk1 signaling. This arrest, unlike others reported previously, depends upon a significant, specific depletion of cyclin B1 and its encoding RNA, which precludes cyclin B1/CDK1 complex function, thus preventing mitotic entry. We show here that while the stability of cyclin B1 RNA was not affected by MVM infection, the production of nascent cyclin B1 RNA was substantially diminished at late times postinfection. Ectopic expression of NS1 alone did not reduce cyclin B1 expression. MVM infection also reduced the levels of cyclin B1 protein, and RNA levels normally increased in response to DNA-damaging reagents. We demonstrated that at times of reduced cyclin B1 expression during infection, there was a significantly reduced occupancy of RNA polymerase II and the essential mitotic transcription factor FoxM1 on the cyclin B1 gene promoter. Additionally, while total FoxM1 levels remained constant, there was a significant decrease of the phosphorylated, likely active, forms of FoxM1. Targeting of a constitutively active FoxM1 construct or the activation domain of FoxM1 to the cyclin B1 gene promoter via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-enzymatically inactive Cas9 in MVM-infected cells increased both cyclin B1 protein and RNA levels, implicating FoxM1 as a critical target for cyclin B1 inhibition during MVM infection.
   IMPORTANCE Replication of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) induces a sustained cellular DNA damage response (DDR) which the virus exploits to prepare the nuclear environment for effective takeover. An essential aspect of the MVM-induced DDR is establishment of a potent premitotic block. This block depends upon a significant, specific depletion of cyclin B1 and its encoding RNA that precludes cyclin B1/CDK1 complex functions necessary for mitotic entry. We show that reduced cyclin B1 expression is controlled primarily at the level of transcription initiation. Additionally, the essential mitotic transcription factor FoxM1 and RNA polymerase II were found to occupy the cyclin B1 gene promoter at reduced levels during infection. Recruiting a constitutively active FoxM1 construct or the activation domain of FoxM1 to the cyclin B1 gene promoter via CRISPR-catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in MVM-infected cells increased expression of both cyclin B1 protein and RNA, implicating FoxM1 as a critical target mediating MVM-induced cyclin B1 inhibition.

AB Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes low mortality but high morbidity rates in humans. In addition to natural outbreaks, there is the potential for exposure to VEEV via aerosolized virus particles. There are currently no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for VEEV. Passive immunotherapy is an approved method used to protect individuals against several pathogens and toxins. Human polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) are ideal, but this is dependent upon serum from convalescent human donors, which is in limited supply. Non-human-derived PAbs can have serious immunoreactivity complications, and when "humanized," these antibodies may exhibit reduced neutralization efficiency. To address these issues, transchromosomic (Tc) bovines have been created, which can produce potent neutralizing human antibodies in response to hyperimmunization. In these studies, we have immunized these bovines with different VEEV immunogens and evaluated the protective efficacy of purified preparations of the resultant human polyclonal antisera against low-and high-dose VEEV challenges. These studies demonstrate that prophylactic or therapeutic administration of the polyclonal antibody preparations (TcPAbs) can protect mice against lethal subcutaneous or aerosol challenge with VEEV. Furthermore, significant protection against unrelated coinfecting viral pathogens can be conferred by combining individual virus-specific TcPAb preparations.
   IMPORTANCE With the globalization and spread or potential aerosol release of emerging infectious diseases, it will be critical to develop platforms that are able to produce therapeutics in a short time frame. By using a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform, it is theoretically possible to produce antigen-specific highly neutralizing therapeutic polyclonal human antibody (TcPAb) preparations in 6 months or less. In this study, we demonstrate that Tc bovine-derived Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)-specific TcPAbs are highly effective against VEEV infection that mimics not only the natural route of infection but also infection via aerosol exposure. Additionally, we show that combinatorial TcPAb preparations can be used to treat coinfections with divergent pathogens, demonstrating that the Tc bovine platform could be beneficial in areas where multiple infectious diseases occur contemporaneously or in the case of multipathogen release.

AB We previously identified a novel inhibitor of influenza virus in mouse saliva that halts the progression of susceptible viruses from the upper to the lower respiratory tract of mice in vivo and neutralizes viral infectivity in MDCK cells. Here, we investigated the viral target of the salivary inhibitor by using reverse genetics to create hybrid viruses with some surface proteins derived from an inhibitor-sensitive strain and others from an inhibitor-resistant strain. These viruses demonstrated that the origin of the viral neuraminidase (NA), but not the hemagglutinin or matrix protein, was the determinant of susceptibility to the inhibitor. Comparison of the NA sequences of a panel of H3N2 viruses with differing sensitivities to the salivary inhibitor revealed that surface residues 368 to 370 (N2 numbering) outside the active site played a key role in resistance. Resistant viruses contained an EDS motif at this location, and mutation to either EES or KDS, found in highly susceptible strains, significantly increased in vitro susceptibility to the inhibitor and reduced the ability of the virus to progress to the lungs when the viral inoculum was initially confined to the upper respiratory tract. In the presence of saliva, viral strains with a susceptible NA could not be efficiently released from the surfaces of infected MDCK cells and had reduced enzymatic activity based on their ability to cleave substrate in vitro. This work indicates that the mouse has evolved an innate inhibitor similar in function, though not in mechanism, to what humans have created synthetically as an antiviral drug for influenza virus.
   IMPORTANCE Despite widespread use of experimental pulmonary infection of the laboratory mouse to study influenza virus infection and pathogenesis, to our knowledge, mice do not naturally succumb to influenza. Here, we show that mice produce their own natural form of neuraminidase inhibitor in saliva that stops the virus from reaching the lungs, providing a possible mechanism through which the species may not experience severe influenza virus infection in the wild. We show that the murine salivary inhibitor targets the outer surface of the influenza virus neuraminidase, possibly occluding entry to the enzymatic site rather than binding within the active site like commercially available neuraminidase inhibitors. This knowledge sheds light on how the natural inhibitors of particular species combat infection.

AB Human herpesviruses 6A/B (HHV-6A/B) can integrate their viral genomes in the telomeres of human chromosomes. The viral and cellular factors contributing to HHV-6A/B integration remain largely unknown, mostly due to the lack of efficient and reproducible cell culture models to study HHV-6A/B integration. In this study, we characterized the HHV-6A/B integration efficiencies in several human cell lines using two different approaches. First, after a short-term infection (5 h), cells were processed for single-cell cloning and analyzed for chromosomally integrated HHV-6A/B (ciHHV-6A/B). Second, cells were infected with HHV-6A/B and allowed to grow in bulk for 4 weeks or longer and then analyzed for the presence of ciHHV-6. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), droplet digital PCR, and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we could demonstrate that HHV-6A/B integrated in most human cell lines tested, including telomerase-positive (HeLa, MCF-7, HCT-116, and HEK293T) and telomerase-negative cell lines (U2OS and GM847). Our results also indicate that inhibition of DNA replication, using phosphonoacetic acid, did not affect HHV-6A/B integration. Certain clones harboring ciHHV-6A/B spontaneously express viral genes and proteins. Treatment of cells with phorbol ester or histone deacetylase inhibitors triggered the expression of many viral genes, including U39, U90, and U100, without the production of infectious virus, suggesting that the tested stimuli were not sufficient to trigger full reactivation. In summary, both integration models yielded comparable results and should enable the identification of viral and cellular factors contributing to HHV6A/B integration and the screening of drugs influencing viral gene expression, as well as the release of infectious HHV-6A/B from the integrated state.
   IMPORTANCE The analysis and understanding of HHV-6A/B genome integration into host DNA is currently limited due to the lack of reproducible and efficient viral integration systems. In the present study, we describe two quantitative cell culture viral integration systems. These systems can be used to define cellular and viral factors that play a role in HHV-6A/B integration. Furthermore, these systems will allow us to decipher the conditions resulting in virus gene expression and excision of the integrated viral genome resulting in reactivation.

AB Controversy still surrounds both the etiology and pathophysiology of vestibular neuritis (VN). Especially uncertain is why the superior vestibular nerve (SVN) is more frequently affected than the inferior vestibular nerve (IVN), which is partially or totally spared. To address this question, we developed an improved method for preparing human vestibular ganglia (VG) and nerve. Subsequently, macro-and microanatomical as well as PCR studies were performed on 38 human ganglia from 38 individuals. The SVN was 2.4 mm longer than the IVN, and in 65% of the cases, the IVN ran in two separate bony canals, which was not the case for the SVN. Anastomoses between the facial and cochlear nerves were more common for the SVN (14/38 and 9/38, respectively) than for the IVN (7/38 and 2/38, respectively). Using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we found only a few latently herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected VG (18.4%). In cases of two separate neuronal fields, infected neurons were located in the superior part only. In summary, these PCR and micro-and macroanatomical studies provide possible explanations for the high frequency of SVN infection in vestibular neuritis.
   IMPORTANCE Vestibular neuritis is known to affect the superior part of the vestibular nerve more frequently than the inferior part. The reason for this clinical phenomenon remains unclear. Anatomical differences may play a role, or if latent HSV-1 infection is assumed, the etiology may be due to the different distribution of the infection. To shed further light on this subject, we conducted different macro-and microanatomical studies. We also assessed the presence of HSV-1 in VG and in different sections of the VG. Our findings add new information on the macro-and microanatomy of the VG as well as the pathophysiology of vestibular neuritis. We also show that latent HSV-1 infection of VG neurons is less frequent than previously reported.

AB We previously isolated a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain, PC177, by blind serial passaging of the intestinal contents of a diarrheic piglet in Vero cell culture. Compared with the highly virulent U.S. PEDV strain PC21A, the tissue culture-adapted PC177 (TC-PC177) contains a 197-amino-acid (aa) deletion in the N-terminal domain of the spike (S) protein. We orally inoculated neonatal, conventional suckling piglets with TC-PC177 or PC21A to compare their pathogenicities. Within 7 days postinoculation, TC-PC177 caused mild diarrhea and lower fecal viral RNA shedding, with no mortality, whereas PC21A caused severe clinical signs and 55% mortality. To investigate whether infection with TC-PC177 can induce cross-protection against challenge with a highly virulent PEDV strain, all the surviving piglets were challenged with PC21A at 3 weeks postinoculation. Compared with 100% protection in piglets initially inoculated with PC21A, 88% and 100% TC-PC177- and mock-inoculated piglets had diarrhea following challenge, respectively, indicating incomplete cross-protection. To investigate whether this 197-aa deletion was the determinant for the attenuation of TC-PC177, we generated a mutant (icPC22A-S1.197) bearing the 197-aa deletion from an infectious cDNA clone of the highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain (infectious clone PC22A, icPC22A). In neonatal gnotobiotic pigs, the icPC22A-S1 Delta 197 virus caused mild to moderate diarrhea, lower titers of viral shedding, and no mortality, whereas the icPC22A virus caused severe diarrhea and 100% mortality. Our data indicate that deletion of this 197-aa fragment in the spike protein can attenuate a highly virulent PEDV, but the virus may lose important epitopes for inducing robust protective immunity.
   IMPORTANCE The emerging, highly virulent PEDV strains have caused substantial economic losses worldwide. However, the virulence determinants are not established. In this study, we found that a 197-aa deletion in the N-terminal region of the S protein did not alter virus (TC-PC177) tissue tropism but reduced the virulence of the highly virulent PEDV strain PC22A in neonatal piglets. We also demonstrated that the primary infection with TC-PC177 failed to induce complete cross-protection against challenge by the highly virulent PEDV PC21A, suggesting that the 197-aa region may contain important epitopes for inducing protective immunity. Our results provide an insight into the role of this large deletion in virus propagation and pathogenicity. In addition, the reverse genetics platform of the PC22A strain was further optimized for the rescue of recombinant PEDV viruses in vitro. This break-through allows us to investigate other virulence determinants of PEDV strains and will provide knowledge leading to better control PEDV infections.

TI Serine 235 Is the Primary NS5A Hyperphosphorylation Site Responsible for

AB The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a phosphoprotein with two phosphorylation states: hypo-and hyperphosphorylation. Genetic mutation studies have demonstrated a cluster of serine residues responsible for NS5A hyperphosphorylation and functions in viral replication and assembly; however, the phosphorylation levels and potential interactions among the serine residues are unclear. We used three specific antibodies to measure NS5A phosphorylation at S222, S235, and S238 that were identified in our previous proteomics study. In the HCV (J6/JFH-1)-infected Huh7.5.1 cells, S222 phosphorylation was barely detected, whereas S235 phosphorylation and S238 phosphorylation were always detected in parallel in time and intracellular spaces. S235A mutation eliminated S238 phosphorylation whereas S238A mutation did not affect S235 phosphorylation, indicating that S235 phosphorylation occurs independently of S238 phosphorylation while S238 phosphorylation depends on S235 phosphorylation. In line with this, immunoprecipitation coupled with immunoblotting showed that S235 phosphorylation existed alone without S238 phosphorylation, whereas S238 phosphorylation existed only when S235 was phosphorylated on the same NS5A molecule. S235phosphorylated NS5A constituted the primary hyperphosphorylated NS5A species. S235A mutation blunted viral replication, whereas S238A mutation did not affect replication. We concluded that S235 is the primary NS5A hyperphosphorylation site required for HCV replication. S238 is likely phosphorylated by casein kinase I alpha, which requires a priming phosphorylation at S235.
   IMPORTANCE It has been known for years that the hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) undergoes transition between two phosphorylation states: hypoand hyperphosphorylation. It is also known that a cluster of serine residues is responsible for NS5A hyperphosphorylation and functions; however, the primary serine residue responsible for NS5A hyperphosphorylation is not clear. Here, we show for the first time that serine 235-phosphorylated NS5A constitutes the primary hyperphosphorylated NS5A species required for viral replication. We also show that NS5A phosphorylation among the serine residues is interdependent and occurs in a directional manner, i. e., phosphorylation at serine 235 leads to phosphorylation at serine 238. Our data provide the first proof-of-principle evidence that NS5A undergoes a sequential phosphorylation cascade.

AB It is possible to model the progression of influenza virus from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract in the mouse using viral inoculum delivered in a restricted manner to the nose. In this model, infection with the A/Udorn/ 307/72 (Udorn) strain of virus results ultimately in high viral titers in both the trachea and lungs. In contrast, the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain causes an infection that is almost entirely limited to the nasal passages. The factors that govern the progression of virus down the respiratory tract are not well understood. Here, we show that, while PR8 virus grows to high titers in the nose, an inhibitor present in the saliva blocks further progression of infection to the trachea and lungs and renders an otherwise lethal dose of virus completely asymptomatic. In vitro, the salivary inhibitor was capable of potent neutralization of PR8 virus and an additional 20 strains of type A virus and two type B strains that were tested. The exceptions were Udorn virus and the closely related H3N2 strains A/Port Chalmers/1/73 and A/Victoria/3/75. Characterization of the salivary inhibitor showed it to be independent of sialic acid and other carbohydrates for its function. This and other biochemical properties, together with its virus strain specificity and in vivo function, indicate that the mouse salivary inhibitor is a previously undescribed innate inhibitory molecule that may have evolved to provide pulmonary protection of the species from fatal influenza virus infection.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus occasionally jumps from aquatic birds, its natural host, into mammals to cause outbreaks of varying severity, including pandemics in humans. Despite the laboratory mouse being used as a model to study influenza virus pathogenesis, natural outbreaks of influenza have not been reported in the species. Here, we shed light on one mechanism that might allow mice to be protected from influenza in the wild. We show that virus deposited in the mouse upper respiratory tract will not progress to the lower respiratory tract due to the presence of a potent inhibitor of the virus in saliva. Containing inhibitor-sensitive virus to the upper respiratory tract renders an otherwise lethal infection subclinical. This knowledge sheds light on how natural inhibitors may have evolved to improve survival in this species.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections remain a major cause of respiratory disease and hospitalizations among infants. Infection recurs frequently and establishes a weak and short-lived immunity. To date, RSV immunoprophylaxis and vaccine research is mainly focused on the RSV fusion (F) protein, but a vaccine remains elusive. The RSV F protein is a highly conserved surface glycoprotein and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection. Here, we analyzed an internalization process of antigen-antibody complexes after binding of RSV-specific antibodies to RSV antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells. The RSV F protein and attachment (G) protein were found to be internalized in both infected and transfected cells after the addition of either RSV-specific polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) or RSV glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as determined by indirect immunofluorescence staining and flow-cytometric analysis. Internalization experiments with different cell lines, well-differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (WD-PBECs), and RSV isolates suggest that antibody internalization can be considered a general feature of RSV. More specifically for RSV F, the mechanism of internalization was shown to be clathrin dependent. All RSV F-targeted MAbs tested, regardless of their epitopes, induced internalization of RSV F. No differences could be observed between the different MAbs, indicating that RSV F internalization was epitope independent. Since this process can be either antiviral, by affecting virus assembly and production, or beneficial for the virus, by limiting the efficacy of antibodies and effector mechanism, further research is required to determine the extent to which this occurs in vivo and how this might impact RSV replication.
   IMPORTANCE Current research into the development of new immunoprophylaxis and vaccines is mainly focused on the RSV F protein since, among others, RSV F-specific antibodies are able to protect infants from severe disease, if administered prophylactically. However, antibody responses established after natural RSV infections are poorly protective against reinfection, and high levels of antibodies do not always correlate with protection. Therefore, RSV might be capable of interfering, at least partially, with antibody-induced neutralization. In this study, a process through which surface-expressed RSV F proteins are internalized after interaction with RSVspecific antibodies is described. One the one hand, this antigen-antibody complex internalization could result in an antiviral effect, since it may interfere with virus particle formation and virus production. On the other hand, this mechanism may also reduce the efficacy of antibody-mediated effector mechanisms toward infected cells.

TI Transmission Bottleneck Size Estimation from Pathogen Deep-Sequencing
   Data, with an Application to Human Influenza A Virus

AB The bottleneck governing infectious disease transmission describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from the donor to the recipient host. Accurate quantification of the bottleneck size is particularly important for rapidly evolving pathogens such as influenza virus, as narrow bottlenecks reduce the amount of transferred viral genetic diversity and, thus, may decrease the rate of viral adaptation. Previous studies have estimated bottleneck sizes governing viral transmission by using statistical analyses of variants identified in pathogen sequencing data. These analyses, however, did not account for variant calling thresholds and stochastic viral replication dynamics within recipient hosts. Because these factors can skew bottleneck size estimates, we introduce a new method for inferring bottleneck sizes that accounts for these factors. Through the use of a simulated data set, we first show that our method, based on beta-binomial sampling, accurately recovers transmission bottleneck sizes, whereas other methods fail to do so. We then apply our method to a data set of influenza A virus (IAV) infections for which viral deepsequencing data from transmission pairs are available. We find that the IAV transmission bottleneck size estimates in this study are highly variable across transmission pairs, while the mean bottleneck size of 196 virions is consistent with a previous estimate for this data set. Furthermore, regression analysis shows a positive association between estimated bottleneck size and donor infection severity, as measured by temperature. These results support findings from experimental transmission studies showing that bottleneck sizes across transmission events can be variable and influenced in part by epidemiological factors.
   IMPORTANCE The transmission bottleneck size describes the size of the pathogen population transferred from the donor to the recipient host and may affect the rate of pathogen adaptation within host populations. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled bottleneck size estimation from pathogen genetic data, although there is not yet a consistency in the statistical methods used. Here, we introduce a new approach to infer the bottleneck size that accounts for variant identification protocols and noise during pathogen replication. We show that failing to account for these factors leads to an underestimation of bottleneck sizes. We apply this method to an existing data set of human influenza virus infections, showing that transmission is governed by a loose, but highly variable, transmission bottleneck whose size is positively associated with the severity of infection of the donor. Beyond advancing our understanding of influenza virus transmission, we hope that this work will provide a standardized statistical approach for bottleneck size estimation for viral pathogens.

AB Although fish possess an efficient interferon (IFN) system to defend against aquatic virus infection, grass carp reovirus (GCRV) still causes hemorrhagic disease in grass carp. To date, GCRV's strategy for evading the fish IFN response is still unknown. Here, we report that GCRV VP41 inhibits fish IFN production by suppressing the phosphorylation of mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (MITA). First, the activation of the IFN promoter (IFNpro) stimulated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and MITA was decreased by the overexpression of VP41, whereas such activation induced by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was not affected. Second, VP41 was colocalized in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated with MITA. Furthermore, as a phosphorylation substrate of TBK1, VP41 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of MITA. Truncation assays indicated that the transmembrane (TM) region of VP41 was indispensable for the suppression of IFNpro activity. Finally, after infection with GCRV, VP41 blunted the transcription of host IFN and facilitated viral RNA synthesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that GCRV VP41 prevents the fish IFN response by attenuating the phosphorylation of MITA for viral evasion.
   IMPORTANCE MITA is thought to act as an adaptor protein to facilitate the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1 upon viral infection, and it plays a critical role in innate antiviral responses. Here, we report that GCRV VP41 colocalizes with MITA at the ER and reduces MITA phosphorylation by acting as a decoy substrate of TBK1, thus inhibiting IFN production. These findings reveal GCRV's strategy for evading the host IFN response for the first time.

AB The capsid domain (CA) of the retroviral Gag protein is a primary determinant of Gag oligomerization, which is a critical step for immature Gag lattice formation and virus particle budding. Although the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CA carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for CA-CA interactions, the CA CTD has been suggested to be largely dispensable for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) particle biogenesis. To more clearly define the roles of the HTLV-1 CA amino-terminal domain (NTD) and CA CTD in particle biogenesis, we generated and analyzed a panel of Gag proteins with chimeric HIV-1/HTLV-1 CA domains. Subcellular distribution and protein expression levels indicated that Gag proteins with a chimeric HIV-1 CA NTD/HTLV-1 CA CTD did not result in Gag oligomerization regardless of the parent Gag background. Furthermore, chimeric Gag proteins with the HTLV-1 CA NTD produced particles phenotypically similar to HTLV-1 immature particles, highlighting the importance of the HTLV-1 CA NTD in HTLV-1 immature particle morphology. Taken together, these observations support the conclusion that the HTLV-1 CA NTD can functionally replace the HIV-1 CA CTD, but the HIV-1 CA NTD cannot replace the HTLV-1 CA CTD, indicating that the HTLV-1 CA subdomains provide distinct contributions to Gag-Gag oligomerization, particle morphology, and biogenesis. Furthermore, we have shown for the first time that HIV-1 and HTLV-1 Gag domains outside the CA (e.g., matrix and nucleocapsid) impact Gag oligomerization as well as immature particle size and morphology.
   IMPORTANCE A key aspect in virus replication is virus particle assembly, which is a poorly understood process for most viruses. For retroviruses, the Gag structural protein is the primary driver of virus particle biogenesis, and the CA CTD is the primary determinant of Gag-Gag interactions for HIV-1. In this study, the HTLV-1 capsid amino-terminal domain was found to provide distinct contributions to Gag-Gag oligomerization, particle morphology, and biogenesis. This study provides information that will aid efforts for discovery of therapeutic targets for intervention.

AB Mosquito-borne arboviruses are a major source of human disease. One strategy to reduce arbovirus disease is to reduce the mosquito's ability to transmit virus. Mosquito infection with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis wMel is a novel strategy to reduce Aedes mosquito competency for flavivirus infection. However, experiments investigating cyclic environmental temperatures have shown a reduction in maternal transmission of wMel, potentially weakening the integration of this strain into a mosquito population relative to that of other Wolbachia strains. Consequently, it is important to investigate additional Wolbachia strains. All Zika virus (ZIKV) suppression studies are limited to the wMel Wolbachia strain. Here we show ZIKV inhibition by two different Wolbachia strains: wAlbB (isolated from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes) and wStri (isolated from the planthopper Laodelphax striatellus) in mosquito cells. Wolbachia strain wStri inhibited ZIKV most effectively. Singlecycle infection experiments showed that ZIKV RNA replication and nonstructural protein 5 translation were reduced below the limits of detection in wStri-containing cells, demonstrating early inhibition of virus replication. ZIKV replication was rescued when Wolbachia was inhibited with a bacteriostatic antibiotic. We observed a partial rescue of ZIKV growth when Wolbachia-infected cells were supplemented with cholesterol-lipid concentrate, suggesting competition for nutrients as one of the possible mechanisms of Wolbachia inhibition of ZIKV. Our data show that wAlbB and wStri infection causes inhibition of ZIKV, making them attractive candidates for further in vitro mechanistic and in vivo studies and future vector-centered approaches to limit ZIKV infection and spread.
   IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) has swiftly spread throughout most of the Western Hemisphere. This is due in large part to its replication in and spread by a mosquito vector host. There is an urgent need for approaches that limit ZIKV replication in mosquitoes. One exciting approach for this is to use a bacterial endosymbiont called Wolbachia that can populate mosquito cells and inhibit ZIKV replication. Here we show that two different strains of Wolbachia, wAlbB and wStri, are effective at repressing ZIKV in mosquito cell lines. Repression of virus growth is through the inhibition of an early stage of infection and requires actively replicating Wolbachia. Our findings further the understanding of Wolbachia viral inhibition and provide novel tools that can be used in an effort to limit ZIKV replication in the mosquito vector, thereby interrupting the transmission and spread of the virus.

AB The emergence of pandemic GII.4 norovirus (NoV) strains has been proposed to occur due to changes in receptor usage and thereby to lead to immune evasion. To address this hypothesis, we measured the ability of human sera collected between 1979 and 2010 to block glycan binding of four pandemic GII. 4 noroviruses isolated in the last 4 decades. In total, 268 sera were investigated for 50% blocking titer (BT50) values of virus-like particles (VLPs) against pig gastric mucin (PGM) using 4 VLPs that represent different GII. 4 norovirus variants identified between 1987 and 2012. Pre- and postpandemic sera (sera collected before and after isolation of the reference NoV strain) efficiently prevented binding of VLP strains MD145 (1987), Grimsby (1995), and Houston (2002), but not the Sydney (2012) strain, to PGM. No statistically significant difference in virus-blocking titers was observed between pre- and postpandemic sera. Moreover, paired sera showed that blocking titers of >= 160 were maintained over a 6-year period against MD145, Grimsby, and Houston VLPs. Significantly higher serum blocking titers (geometric mean titer [GMT], 1,704) were found among IgA-deficient individuals than among healthy blood donors (GMT, 90.9) (P < 0.0001). The observation that prepandemic sera possess robust blocking capacity for viruses identified decades later suggests a common attachment factor, at least until 2002. Our results indicate that serum IgG possesses antibody-blocking capacity and that blocking titers can be maintained for at least 6 years against 3 decades of pandemic GII. 4 NoV.
   IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (NoVs) are the major cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in saliva and gut recognize NoV and are the proposed ligands that facilitate infection. Polymorphisms in HBGA genes, and in particular a nonsense mutation in FUT2 (G428A), result in resistance to global dominating GII. 4 NoV. The emergence of new pandemic GII. 4 strains occurs at intervals of several years and is proposed to be attributable to epochal evolution, including amino acid changes and immune evasion. However, it remains unclear whether exposure to a previous pandemic strain stimulates immunity to a pandemic strain identified decades later. We found that prepandemic sera possess robust virus-blocking capacity against viruses identified several decades later. We also show that serum lacking IgA antibodies is sufficient to block NoV VLP binding to HBGAs. This is essential, considering that 1 in every 600 Caucasian children is IgA deficient.

AB Despite a great deal of prior research, the early pathogenic events in natural oral poliovirus infection remain poorly defined. To establish a model for study, we infected 39 macaques by feeding them single high doses of the virulent Mahoney strain of wild type 1 poliovirus. Doses ranging from 107 to 109 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) consistently infected all the animals, and many monkeys receiving 108 or 109 TCID50 developed paralysis. There was no apparent difference in the susceptibilities of the three macaque species (rhesus, cynomolgus, and bonnet) used. Virus excretion in stool and nasopharynges was consistently observed, with occasional viremia, and virus was isolated from tonsils, gut mucosa, and draining lymph nodes. Viral replication proteins were detected in both epithelial and lymphoid cell populations expressing CD155 in the tonsil and intestine, as well as in spinal cord neurons. Necrosis was observed in these three cell types, and viral replication in the tonsil/ gut was associated with histopathologic destruction and inflammation. The sustained response of neutralizing antibody correlated temporally with resolution of viremia and termination of virus shedding in oropharynges and feces. For the first time, this model demonstrates that early in the infectious process, poliovirus replication occurs in both epithelial cells (explaining virus shedding in the gastrointestinal tract) and lymphoid/monocytic cells in tonsils and Peyer's patches (explaining viremia), extending previous studies of poliovirus pathogenesis in humans. Because the model recapitulates human poliovirus infection and poliomyelitis, it can be used to study polio pathogenesis and to assess the efficacy of candidate antiviral drugs and new vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE Early pathogenic events of poliovirus infection remain largely undefined, and there is a lack of animal models mimicking natural oral human infection leading to paralytic poliomyelitis. All 39 macaques fed with single high doses ranging from 107 to 109 TCID50 Mahoney type 1 virus were infected, and many of the monkeys developed paralysis. Virus excretion in stool and nasopharynges was consistently observed, with occasional viremia; tonsil, mesentery lymph nodes, and intestinal mucosa served as major target sites of viral replication. For the first time, this model demonstrates that early in the infectious process, poliovirus replication occurs in both epithelial cells (explaining virus shedding in the gastrointestinal tract) and lymphoid/monocytic cells in tonsils and Peyer's patches (explaining viremia), thereby supplementing historical reconstructions of poliovirus pathogenesis. Because the model recapitulates human poliovirus infection and poliomyelitis, it can be used to study polio pathogenesis, candidate antiviral drugs, and the efficacy of new vaccines.

AB HIV-1 is rare among viruses for having a low number of envelope glycoprotein (Env) spikes per virion, i.e., similar to 7 to 14. This exceptional feature has been associated with avoidance of humoral immunity, i.e., B cell activation and antibody neutralization. Virus-like particles (VLPs) with increased density of Env are being pursued for vaccine development; however, these typically require protein engineering that alters Env structure. Here, we used instead a strategy that targets the producer cell. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort for cells that are recognized by trimer cross-reactive broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) and not by nonneutralizing antibodies. Following multiple iterations of FACS, cells and progeny virions were shown to display higher levels of antigenically correct Env in a manner that correlated between cells and cognate virions (P = 0.027). High-Env VLPs, or hVLPs, were shown to be monodisperse and to display more than a 10-fold increase in spikes per particle by electron microscopy (average, 127 spikes; range, 90 to 214 spikes). Sequencing revealed a partial truncation in the C-terminal tail of Env that had emerged in the sort; however, iterative rounds of "cell factory" selection were required for the high-Env phenotype. hVLPs showed greater infectivity than standard pseudovirions but largely similar neutralization sensitivity. Importantly, hVLPs also showed superior activation of Env-specific B cells. Hence, high-Env HIV-1 virions, obtained through selection of producer cells, represent an adaptable platform for vaccine design and should aid in the study of native Env.
   IMPORTANCE The paucity of spikes on HIV is a unique feature that has been associated with evasion of the immune system, while increasing spike density has been a goal of vaccine design. Increasing the density of Env by modifying it in various ways has met with limited success. Here, we focused instead on the producer cell. Cells that stably express HIV spikes were screened on the basis of high binding by bnAbs and low binding by nonneutralizing antibodies. Levels of spikes on cells correlated well with those on progeny virions. Importantly, high-Env virus-like particles (hVLPs) were produced with a manifest array of well-defined spikes, and these were shown to be superior in activating desirable B cells. Our study describes HIV particles that are densely coated with functional spikes, which should facilitate the study of HIV spikes and their development as immunogens.

AB Cellular stress responses to energy insufficiency can impact virus reproduction. In particular, activation of the host AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by low energy could limit protein synthesis by inhibiting mTORC1. Although many herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), stimulate mTORC1, how HSV-1-infected cells respond to energy availability, a physiological indicator regulating mTORC1, has not been investigated. In addition, the impact of low-energy stress on productive HSV-1 growth and viral genetic determinants potentially enabling replication under physiological stress remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 activity in HSV-1-infected cells is largely insensitive to stress induced by simulated energy insufficiency. Furthermore, resistance of mTORC1 activity to low-energy-induced stress, while not significantly influenced by the HSV-1 UL46-encoded phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt activator, was dependent upon the Ser/Thr kinase activity of Us3. A Us3-deficient virus was hypersensitive to low-energy-induced stress as infected cell protein synthesis and productive replication were reduced compared to levels in cells infected with a Us3-expressing virus. Although Us3 did not detectably prevent energy stress-induced AMPK activation, it enforced mTORC1 activation despite the presence of activated AMPK. In the absence of applied low-energy stress, AMPK activity in infected cells was restricted in a Us3-dependent manner. This establishes that the Us3 kinase not only activated mTORC1 but also enabled sustained mTORC1 signaling during simulated energy insufficiency that would otherwise restrict protein synthesis and virus replication. Moreover, it identifies the alphaherpesvirus-specific Us3 kinase as an mTORC1 activator that subverts the host cell energy-sensing program to support viral productive growth irrespective of physiological stress.
   IMPORTANCE Like all viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) reproduction relies upon numerous host energy-intensive processes, the most demanding of which is protein synthesis. In response to low energy, the cellular AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) triggers a physiological stress response that antagonizes mTORC1, a multisubunit host kinase that controls protein synthesis. This could restrict virus protein production and growth. Here, we establish that the HSV-1 Us3 protein kinase subverts the normal response to low-energy-induced stress. While Us3 does not prevent AMPK activation by low energy, it enforces mTORC1 activation and overrides a physiological response that couples energy availability and protein synthesis. These results help explain how reproduction of HSV-1, a ubiquitous, medically significant human pathogen causing a spectrum of diseases ranging from the benign to the life threatening, occurs during physiological stress. This is important because HSV-1 reproduction triggered by physiological stress is characteristic of reactivation of lifelong latent infections.

AB Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes lifelong latency. The viral latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) promotes viral persistence by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes and by participating in latent DNA replication. Recently, the structure of the LANA C-terminal DNA binding domain was solved and new cytoplasmic variants of LANA were discovered. We discuss how these findings contribute to our current view of LANA structure and assembly and of its role during viral persistence.

AB A single dominantly expressed allele of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) may be responsible for the duck's high tolerance to highly pathogenic influenza A virus (HP-IAV) compared to the chicken's lower tolerance. In this study, the crystal structures of duck MHC I (Anpl-UAA*01) and duck beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) with two peptides from the H5N1 strains were determined. Two remarkable features were found to distinguish the Anpl-UAA*01 complex from other known MHC I structures. A disulfide bond formed by Cys(95) and Cys(112) and connecting the beta 5 and beta 6 sheets at the bottom of peptide binding groove (PBG) in Anpl-UAA*01 complex, which can enhance IAV peptide binding, was identified. Moreover, the interface area between duck MHC I and beta 2m was found to be larger than in other species. In addition, the two IAV peptides that display distinctive conformations in the PBG, B, and F pockets act as the primary anchor sites. Thirty-one IAV peptides were used to verify the peptide binding motif of Anpl-UAA*01, and the results confirmed that the peptide binding motif is similar to that of HLA-A*0201. Based on this motif, approximately 600 peptides from the IAV strains were partially verified as the candidate epitope peptides for Anpl-UAA*01, which is a far greater number than those for chicken BF2*2101 and BF2*0401 molecules. Extensive IAV peptide binding should allow for ducks with this Anpl-UAA*01 haplotype to resist IAV infection.
   IMPORTANCE Ducks are natural reservoirs of influenza A virus (IAV) and are more resistant to the IAV than chickens. Both ducks and chickens express only one dominant MHC I locus providing resistance to the virus. To investigate how MHC I provides IAV resistance, crystal structures of the dominantly expressed duck MHC class I (pAnpl-UAA*01) with two IAV peptides were determined. A disulfide bond was identified in the peptide binding groove that can facilitate Anpl-UAA*01 binding to IAV peptides. Anpl-UAA*01 has a much wider recognition spectrum of IAV epitope peptides than do chickens. The IAV peptides bound by Anpl-UAA*01 display distinctive conformations that can help induce an extensive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. In addition, the interface area between the duck MHC I and beta 2m is larger than in other species. These results indicate that HP-IAV resistance in ducks is due to extensive CTL responses induced by MHC I.

TI Cellular Cholesterol Facilitates the Postentry Replication Cycle of

AB Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and is required for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry (1-3). Treatment of HSV-1-infected Vero cells with methyl beta-cyclodextrin from 2 to 9 h postentry reduced plaque numbers. Transport of incoming viral capsids to the nuclear periphery was unaffected by the cholesterol reduction, suggesting that cell cholesterol is important for the HSV-1 replicative cycle at a stage(s) beyond entry, after the arrival of capsids at the nucleus. The synthesis and release of infectious HSV-1 and cell-to-cell spread of infection were all impaired in cholesterol-reduced cells. Propagation of HSV-1 on DHCR24 -/- fibroblasts, which lack the desmosterol-to-cholesterol conversion enzyme, resulted in the generation of infectious extracellular virions (HSVdes) that lack cholesterol and likely contain desmosterol. The specific infectivities (PFU per viral genome) of HSVchol and HSVdes were similar, suggesting cholesterol and desmosterol in the HSV envelope support similar levels of infectivity. However, infected DHCR24 -/- fibroblasts released similar to 1 log less infectious HSVdes and similar to 1.5 log fewer particles than release of cholesterol-containing particles (HSVchol) from parental fibroblasts, suggesting that the hydrocarbon tail of cholesterol facilitates viral synthesis. Together, the results suggest multiple roles for cholesterol in the HSV-1 replicative cycle.
   IMPORTANCE HSV-1 infections are associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations that are of public health importance. Cholesterol is a key player in the complex interaction between viral and cellular factors that allows HSV-1 to enter host cells and establish infection. Previous reports have demonstrated a role for cellular cholesterol in the entry of HSV-1 into target cells. Here, we employed both chemical treatment and cells that were genetically defined to synthesize only desmosterol to demonstrate that cholesterol is important at stages following the initial entry and transport of viral capsids to the nucleus. Viral protein expression, encapsidation of the viral genome, and the release of mature virions were impacted by the reduction of cellular cholesterol. Cholesterol was also critical for cell-to-cell spread of infection. These findings provide new insights into the cholesterol dependence of HSV-1 replication.

AB African swine fever virus, a double-stranded DNA virus that infects pigs, is the only known member of the Asfarviridae family. Nevertheless, during our isolation and sequencing of the complete genome of faustovirus, followed by the description of kaumoebavirus, carried out over the past 2 years, we observed the emergence of previously unknown related viruses within this group of viruses. Here we describe the isolation of pacmanvirus, a fourth member in this group, which is capable of infecting Acanthamoeba castellanii. Pacmanvirus A23 has a linear compact genome of 395,405 bp, with a 33.62% G + C content. The pacmanvirus genome harbors 465 genes, with a high coding density. An analysis of reciprocal best hits shows that 31 genes are conserved between African swine fever virus, pacmanvirus, faustovirus, and kaumoebavirus. Moreover, the major capsid protein locus of pacmanvirus appears to be different from those of kaumoebavirus and faustovirus. Overall, comparative and genomic analyses reveal the emergence of a new group or cluster of viruses encompassing African swine fever virus, faustovirus, pacmanvirus, and kaumoebavirus.
   IMPORTANCE Pacmanvirus is a newly discovered icosahedral double-stranded DNA virus that was isolated from an environmental sample by amoeba coculture. We describe herein its structure and replicative cycle, along with genomic analysis and genomic comparisons with previously known viruses. This virus represents the third virus, after faustovirus and kaumoebavirus, that is most closely related to classical representatives of the Asfarviridae family. These results highlight the emergence of previously unknown double-stranded DNA viruses which delineate and extend the diversity of a group around the asfarvirus members.

AB The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) fusion (F) protein is considered a major target of the neutralizing antibody response to hRSV. This glycoprotein undergoes a major structural shift from the prefusion (pre-F) to the postfusion (post-F) state at the time of virus-host cell membrane fusion. Recent evidences suggest that the pre-F state is a superior target for neutralizing antibodies compared to the post-F state. Therefore, for vaccine purposes, we have designed and characterized a recombinant hRSV F protein, called Pre-F-GCN4t, stabilized in a pre-F conformation. To show that Pre-F-GCN4t does not switch to a post-F conformation, it was compared with a recombinant post-F molecule, called Post-F-XC. Pre-F-GCN4t was glycosylated and trimeric and displayed a conformational stability different from that of Post-F-XC, as shown by chemical denaturation. Electron microscopy analysis suggested that Pre-F-GCN4t adopts a lollipop-like structure. In contrast, Post-F-XC had a typical elongated conical shape. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry demonstrated that the two molecules had common rigid folding core and dynamic regions and provided structural insight for their biophysical and biochemical properties and reactivity. Pre-F-GCN4t was shown to deplete hRSV-neutralizing antibodies from human serum more efficiently than Post-F-XC. Importantly, Pre-F-GCN4t was also shown to bind D25, a highly potent monoclonal antibody specific for the pre-F conformation. In conclusion, this construct presents several pre-F characteristics, does not switch to the post-F conformation, and presents antigenic features required for a protective neutralizing antibody response. Therefore. Pre-F-GCN4t can be considered a promising candidate vaccine antigen.
   IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a global leading cause of infant mortality and adult morbidity. The development of a safe and efficacious RSV vaccine remains an important goal. The RSV class I fusion (F) glycoprotein is considered one of the most promising vaccine candidates, and recent evidences suggest that the prefusion (pre-F) state is a superior target for neutralizing antibodies. Our study presents the physicochemical characterization of Pre-F-GCN4t, a molecule designed to be stabilized in the pre-F conformation. To confirm its pre-F conformation. Pre-F-GCN4t was analyzed in parallel with Post-F-XC, a molecule in the post-F conformation. Our results show that Pre-F-GCN4t presents characteristics of a stabilized pre-F conformation and support its use as an RSV vaccine antigen. Such an antigen may represent a significant advance in the development of an RSV vaccine.

AB The final step of lysis in phage lambda infections of Escherichia coli is mediated by the spanins Rz and Rz1. These proteins form a complex that bridges the cell envelope and that has been proposed to cause fusion of the inner and outer membranes. Accordingly, mutations that block spanin function are found within coiledcoil domains and the proline-rich region, motifs essential in other fusion systems. To gain insight into spanin function, pseudorevertant alleles that restored plaque formation for lysis-defective mutants of Rz and Rz1 were selected. Most second-site suppressors clustered within a coiled-coil domain of Rz near the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and were not allele specific. Suppressors largely encoded polar insertions within the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil interface. Such suppressor changes resulted in decreased proteolytic stability of the Rz double mutants in vivo. Unlike the wild type, in which lysis occurs while the cells retain a rod shape, revertant alleles with second-site suppressor mutations supported lysis events that were preceded by spherical cell formation. This suggests that destabilization of the membrane-proximal coiled coil restores function for defective spanin alleles by increasing the conformational freedom of the complex at the cost of its normal, all-ornothing functionality.
   IMPORTANCE Caudovirales encode cell envelope-spanning proteins called spanins, which are thought to fuse the inner and outer membranes during phage lysis. Recent genetic analysis identified the functional domains of the lambda spanins, which are similar to class I viral fusion proteins. While the pre-and postfusion structures of model fusion systems have been well characterized, the intermediate structure(s) formed during the fusion reaction remains elusive. Genetic analysis would be expected to identify functional connections between intermediates. Since most membrane fusion systems are not genetically tractable, only few such investigations have been reported. Here, we report a suppressor analysis of lambda spanin function. To our knowledge this is the first suppression analysis of a class I-like complex and also the first such analysis of a prokaryote membrane fusion system.

AB Severe complications of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection might be caused by inflammation, but how ZIKV induces proinflammatory cytokines is not understood. In this study, we show opposite regulatory effects of the ZIKV NS5 protein on interferon (IFN) signaling. Whereas ZIKV and its NS5 protein were potent suppressors of type I and type III IFN signaling, they were found to activate type II IFN signaling. Inversely, IFN-gamma augmented ZIKV replication. NS5 interacted with STAT2 and targeted it for ubiquitination and degradation, but it had no influence on STAT1 stability or nuclear translocation. The recruitment of STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 to IFN-beta-stimulated genes was compromised when NS5 was expressed. Concurrently, the formation of STAT1-STAT1 homodimers and their recruitment to IFN-gamma-stimulated genes, such as the gene encoding the proinflammatory cytokine CXCL10, were augmented. Silencing the expression of an IFN-gamma receptor subunit or treatment of ZIKV-infected cells with a JAK2 inhibitor suppressed viral replication and viral induction of IFN-gamma-stimulated genes. Taken together, our findings provide a new mechanism by which the ZIKV NS5 protein differentially regulates IFN signaling to facilitate viral replication and cause diseases. This activity might be shared by a group of viral IFN modulators.
   IMPORTANCE Mammalian cells produce three types of interferons to combat viral infection and to control host immune responses. To replicate and cause diseases, pathogenic viruses have developed different strategies to defeat the action of host interferons. Many viral proteins, including the Zika virus (ZIKV) NS5 protein, are known to be able to suppress the antiviral property of type I and type III interferons. Here we further show that the ZIKV NS5 protein can also boost the activity of type II interferon to induce cellular proteins that promote inflammation. This is mediated by the differential effect of the ZIKV NS5 protein on a pair of cellular transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT2. NS5 induces the degradation of STAT2 but promotes the formation of STAT1-STAT1 protein complexes, which activate genes controlled by type II interferon. A drug that specifically inhibits the IFN-gamma receptor or STAT1 shows an anti-ZIKV effect and might also have anti-inflammatory activity.

AB Poxviruses use a complex strategy to escape immune control, by expressing immunomodulatory proteins that could limit their use as vaccine vectors. To test the role of poxvirus NFKB pathway inhibitors A52, B15, and K7 in immunity, we deleted their genes in an NYVAC (New York vaccinia virus) strain that expresses HIV1 dade C antigens. After infection of mice, ablation of the A52R, 815R, and K7R genes increased dendritic cell, natural killer cell, and neutrophil migration as well as chemokine/cytokine expression. Revertant viruses with these genes confirmed their role in inhibiting the innate immune system. To different extents, enhanced innate immune responses correlated with increased HIV Pol- and Gagspecific polyfunctional CD8 T cell and HIV Envspecific IgG responses induced by single-, double-, and tripledeletion mutants. These poxvirus proteins thus influence innate and adaptive cellmediated and humoral immunity, and their ablation offers alternatives for design of vaccine vectors that regulate immune responses distinctly.
   IMPORTANCE Poxvirus vectors are used in clinical trials as candidate vaccines for several pathogens, yet how these vectors influence the immune system is unknown. We developed distinct poxvirus vectors that express heterologous antigens but lack different inhibitors of the central hostcell signaling pathway. Using mice, we studied the capacity of these viruses to induce innate and adaptive immune responses and showed that these vectors can distinctly regulate the magnitude and quality of these responses. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism of poxvirus-induced immune response and alternative strategies for vaccine vector design.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) requires multiple receptors for its attachment to and entry into cells. Our previous studies found that human syndecan-1 (SDC-1), SDC-2, and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 1 (TIM-1) are HCV attachment receptors. Other cell surface molecules, such as CD81, Claudin-1 (CLDN1), Occludin (OCLN), SR-BI, and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), function mainly at postattachment steps and are considered postattachment receptors. The underlying molecular mechanisms of different receptors in HCV cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission remain elusive. In the present study, we used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology, gene-specific small interfering RNAs, and a newly developed luciferase-based reporter system to quantitatively determine the importance of individual receptors in HCV cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission. Knockouts of SDC-1 and SDC-2 resulted in remarkable reductions of HCV infection and cell attachment, whereas SDC-3 and SDC-4 knockouts did not affect HCV infection. Defective HCV attachment to SDC-1 and/or SDC-2 knockout cells was completely restored by SDC-1 and SDC-2 but not SDC-4 expression. Knockout of the attachment receptors SDC-1, SDC-2, and TIM-1 also modestly decreased HCV cell-to-cell transmission. In contrast, silencing and knockout of the postattachment receptors CD81, CLDN1, OCLN, SR-RI, and LDLR greatly impaired both HCV cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission. Additionally, apolipoprotein E was found to be important for HCV cell-to-cell spread, but very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-containing mouse serum did not affect HCV cell-to-cell transmission, although it inhibited cell-free infection. These findings demonstrate that attachment receptors are essential for initial HCV binding and that postattachment receptors are important for both HCV cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission.
   IMPORTANCE The importance and underlying molecular mechanisms of cell surface receptors in HCV cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission are poorly understood. The role of some of the HCV attachment and postattachment receptors in HCV infection and cell-to-cell spread remains controversial. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts of specific cellular genes, we demonstrate that both SDC-1 and SDC-2, but not SDC-3 or SDC-4, are bona fide HCV attachment receptors. We also used a newly developed luciferase-based reporter system to quantitatively determine the importance of attachment and postattachment receptors in HCV cell-to-cell transmission. SDC-1, SDC-2, TIM-1, and SR-RI were found to modestly promote HCV cell-to-cell spread. CD81, CLDN1, OCLN, and LDLR play more important roles in HCV cell-to-cell transmission. Likewise, apolipoprotein E (apoE) is critically important for HCV cell-to-cell spread, unlike VLDL-containing mouse serum, which did not affect HCV cell-to-cell spread. These findings suggest that the mechanism(s) of HCV cell-to-cell spread differs from that of cell-free infection.

AB Chrysochromulina ericina virus CeV-01B (CeV) was isolated from Norwegian coastal waters in 1998. Its icosahedral particle is 160 nm in diameter and encloses a 474-kb double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. This virus, although infecting a microalga (the haptophyceae Haptolina ericina, formerly Chrysochromulina ericina), is phylo-genetically related to members of the Mimiviridae family, initially established with the acanthamoeba-infecting mimivirus and megavirus as prototypes. This family was later split into two genera (Mimivirus and Cafeteriavirus) following the characterization of a virus infecting the heterotrophic stramenopile Cafeteria roenbergensis (CroV). CeV, as well as two of its close relatives, which infect the unicellular photosynthetic eu-karyotes Phaeocystis globosa (Phaeocystis globosa virus [PgV]) and Aureococcus anophagefferens (Aureococcus anophagefferens virus [AaV]), are currently unclassified by the International Committee on Viral Taxonomy (ICTV). The detailed comparative analysis of the CeV genome presented here confirms the phylogenetic affinity of this emerging group of microalga-infecting viruses with the Mimiviridae but argues in favor of their classification inside a distinct clade within the family. Although CeV, PgV, and AaV share more common features among them than with the larger Mimiviridae, they also exhibit a large complement of unique genes, attesting to their complex evolutionary history. We identified several gene fusion events and cases of convergent evolution involving independent lateral gene acquisitions. Finally, CeV possesses an unusual number of inteins, some of which are closely related despite being inserted in nonhomologous genes. This appears to contradict the paradigm of allele-specific inteins and suggests that the Mimiviridae are especially efficient in spreading inteins while enlarging their repertoire of homing genes.
   IMPORTANCE Although it infects the microalga Chrysochromulina ericina, CeV is more closely related to acanthamoeba-infecting viruses of the Mimiviridae family than to any member of the Phycodnaviridae, the ICTV-approved family historically including all alga-infecting large dsDNA viruses. CeV, as well as its relatives that infect the microalgae Phaeocystic globosa (PgV) and Aureococcus anophagefferens (AaV), remains officially unclassified and a source of confusion in the literature. Our comparative analysis of the CeV genome in the context of this emerging group of algainfecting viruses suggests that they belong to a distinct clade within the established Mimiviridae family. The presence of a large number of unique genes as well as specific gene fusion events, evolutionary convergences, and inteins integrated at unusual locations document the complex evolutionary history of the CeV lineage.

AB Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/B) can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of human chromosomes using a mechanism that remains poorly understood. To achieve a better understanding of the HHV-6A/B integration mechanism, we made use of BRACO-19, a compound that stabilizes G-quadruplex secondary structures and prevents telomere elongation by the telomerase complex. First, we analyzed the folding of telomeric sequences into G-quadruplex structures and their binding to BRACO-19 using G-quadruplex-specific antibodies and surface plasmon resonance. Circular dichroism studies indicate that BRACO-19 modifies the conformation and greatly stabilizes the G-quadruplexes formed in G-rich telomeric DNA. Subsequently we assessed the effects of BRACO-19 on the HHV-6A initial phase of infection. Our results indicate that BRACO-19 does not affect entry of HHV-6A DNA into cells. We next investigated if stabilization of G-quadruplexes by BRACO-19 affected HHV-6A's ability to integrate its genome into host chromosomes. Incubation of telomerase-expressing cells with BRACO-19, such as HeLa and MCF-7, caused a significant reduction in the HHV-6A integration frequency (P < 0.002); in contrast, BRACO-19 had no effect on HHV-6 integration frequency in U2OS cells that lack telomerase activity and elongate their telomeres through alternative lengthening mechanisms. Our data suggest that the fluidity of telomeres is important for efficient chromosomal integration of HHV-6A and that interference with telomerase activity negatively affects the generation of cellular clones containing integrated HHV-6A.
   IMPORTANCE HHV-6A/B can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of infected cells. Telomeres consist of repeated hexanucleotides (TTAGGG) of various lengths (up to several kilobases) and end with a single-stranded 3' extension. To avoid recognition and induce a DNA damage response, the single-stranded overhang folds back on itself and forms a telomeric loop (T-loop) or adopts a tertiary structure, referred to as a G-quadruplex. In the current study, we have examined the effects of a G-quadruplex binding and stabilizing agent, BRACO-19, on HHV-6A chromosomal integration. By stabilizing G-quadruplex structures, BRACO-19 affects the ability of the telomerase complex to elongate telomeres. Our results indicate that BRACO-19 reduces the number of clones harboring integrated HHV-6A. This study is the first of its kind and suggests that telomerase activity is essential to restore a functional telomere of adequate length following HHV-6A integration.

AB Rubicon is part of a Beclin-1-Vps34-containing autophagy complex. Rubicon induces antimicrobial responses upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and functions as a feedback inhibitor to prevent unbalanced proinflammatory responses depending on dectin-1 signaling. However, the role played by Rubicon during antiviral immune responses, particularly the type I interferon (IFN) responses, remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Rubicon acts as a negative regulator for virus-triggered IFN signaling. Knockdown of Rubicon promoted type I interferon signaling and inhibited virus replication, while overexpression of Rubicon had the opposite effect. Rubicon specifically interacts with the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain (IAD) of IRF3, and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3, which negatively regulates IFN-mediated antiviral response. Thus, our findings suggest the novel additional role of Rubicon as a negative regulator that inhibits the IFN signaling and cellular antiviral responses, providing a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition.
   IMPORTANCE The type I IFN system is a critical innate immune response that protects organisms against virus infection. However, type I IFN signaling must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive production of IFNs. Hence, negative regulatory mechanisms for type I IFN signaling are important, and to date, several related molecules have been identified. Here, we show that Rubicon is a major negative regulator of type I IFN signaling, and unlike previous reports of cellular molecules that inhibit IRF3 activation via proteasomal degradation or dephosphorylation of IRF3, we show that Rubicon interacts with IRF3 and that ultimately this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3. Thus, we identified a novel negative regulator of type I IFN signaling pathways and a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the role of negative-feedback mechanisms that regulate type I IFN signaling and maintain immune homeostasis.

TI Virion-Associated Vpr Alleviates a Postintegration Block to HIV-1

AB Viral protein R (Vpr) is an HIV-1 accessory protein whose function remains poorly understood. In this report, we sought to determine the requirement of Vpr for facilitating HIV-1 infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), one of the first cell types to encounter virus in the peripheral mucosal tissues. In this report, we characterize a significant restriction of Vpr-deficient virus replication and spread in MDDCs alone and in cell-to-cell spread in MDDC-CD4(+) T cell cocultures. This restriction of HIV-1 replication in MDDCs was observed in a single round of virus replication and was rescued by the expression of Vpr in trans in the incoming virion. Interestingly, infections of MDDCs with viruses that encode Vpr mutants unable to interact with either the DCAF1/DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or a host factor hypothesized to be targeted for degradation by Vpr also displayed a significant replication defect. While the extent of proviral integration in HIV-1-infected MDDCs was unaffected by the absence of Vpr, the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) from Vpr-deficient proviruses was significantly reduced. Together, these results characterize a novel postintegration restriction of HIV-1 replication in MDDCs and show that the interaction of Vpr with the DCAF1/DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and the yet-to-be-identified host factor might alleviate this restriction by inducing transcription from the viral LTR. Taken together, these findings identify a robust in vitro cell culture system that is amenable to addressing mechanisms underlying Vpr-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication.
   IMPORTANCE Despite decades of work, the function of the HIV-1 protein Vpr remains poorly understood, primarily due to the lack of an in vitro cell culture system that demonstrates a deficit in replication upon infection with viruses in the absence of Vpr. In this report, we describe a novel cell infection system that utilizes primary human dendritic cells, which display a robust decrease in viral replication upon infection with Vpr-deficient HIV-1. We show that this replication difference occurs in a single round of infection and is due to decreased transcriptional output from the integrated viral genome. Viral transcription could be rescued by virion-associated Vpr. Using mutational analysis, we show that domains of Vpr involved in binding to the DCAF1/DDB1/E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and prevention of cell cycle progression into mitosis are required for LTR-mediated viral expression, suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved G(2) cell cycle arrest function of Vpr is essential for HIV-1 replication.

AB H9N2 avian influenza viruses are enzootic in poultry across Asia and North Africa, where they pose a threat to human health as both zoonotic agents and potential pandemic candidates. Poultry vaccination against H9N2 viruses has been employed in many regions; however, vaccine effectiveness is frequently compromised due to antigenic drift arising from amino acid substitutions in the major influenza virus antigen hemagglutinin (HA). Using selection with HA-specific monoclonal antibodies, we previously identified H9N2 antibody escape mutants that contained deletions of amino acids in the 220 loop of the HA receptor binding sites (RBSs). Here we analyzed the impact of these deletions on virus zoonotic infection characteristics and fitness. We demonstrated that mutant viruses with RBS deletions are able to escape polyclonal antiserum binding and are able to infect and be transmitted between chickens. We showed that the deletion mutants have increased binding to human-like receptors and greater replication in primary human airway cells; however, the mutant HAs also displayed reduced pH and thermal stability. In summary, we infer that variant influenza viruses with deletions in the 220 loop could arise in the field due to immune selection pressure; however, due to reduced HA stability, we conclude that these viruses are unlikely to be transmitted from human to human by the airborne route, a prerequisite for pandemic emergence. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between antigenic drift and viral fitness for avian influenza viruses as well as the challenges of predicting which viral variants may pose the greatest threats for zoonotic and pandemic emergence.
   IMPORTANCE Avian influenza viruses, such as H9N2, cause disease in poultry as well as occasionally infecting humans and are therefore considered viruses with pandemic potential. Many countries have introduced vaccination of poultry to try to control the disease burden; however, influenza viruses are able to rapidly evolve to escape immune pressure in a process known as "antigenic drift." Previously, we experimentally generated antigenic-drift variants in the laboratory, and here, we test our "drifted" viruses to assess their zoonotic infection characteristics and transmissibility in chickens. We found that the drifted viruses were able to infect and be transmitted between chickens and showed increased binding to human-like receptors. However, the drift mutant viruses displayed reduced stability, and we predict that they are unlikely to be transmitted from human to human and cause an influenza pandemic. These results demonstrate the complex relationship between antigenic drift and the potential of avian influenza viruses to infect humans.

AB Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), CV-A6, and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) belong to the Picomaviridae family and are major causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and pediatric respiratory disease worldwide. The biological characteristics of these viruses, especially their interplay with the host innate immune system, have not been well investigated. In this study, we discovered that the 3C(pro) proteins from CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 bind melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and inhibit its interaction with MAVS. Consequently, MDA5-triggered type I interferon (IFN) signaling in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) pathway was blocked by the CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 3C(pro) proteins. Furthermore, the CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 3C(pro) proteins all cleave transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), resulting in the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, a host response also critical for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling. Thus, our data demonstrate that circulating HFMD-associated CV-A16 and CV-A6, as well as severe respiratory disease-associated EV-D68, have developed novel mechanisms to subvert host innate immune responses by targeting key factors in the RLR and TLR pathways. Blocking the ability of 3C(pro) proteins from diverse enteroviruses and cox-sackieviruses to interfere with type I IFN induction should restore IFN antiviral function, offering a potential novel antiviral strategy.
   IMPORTANCE CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 are emerging pathogens associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease and pediatric respiratory disease worldwide. The pathogenic mechanisms of these viruses are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 3C(pro) proteins block MDA5-triggered type I IFN induction. The 3C(pro) proteins of these viruses bind MDA5 and inhibit its interaction with MAVS. In addition, the CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 3C(pro) proteins cleave TAK1 to inhibit the NF-kappa B response. Thus, our data demonstrate that circulating HFMD-associated CV-A16 and CV-A6, as well as severe respiratory disease-associated EV-D68, have developed a mechanism to subvert host innate immune responses by simultaneously targeting key factors in the RLR and TLR pathways. These findings indicate the potential merit of targeting the CV-A16, CV-A6, and EV-D68 3C(pro) proteins as an antiviral strategy.

AB Enteroviruses (EVs) are implicated in a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. In this study, a novel enterovirus (enterovirus species G [EVG]) (EVG 08/NC_USA/2015) was isolated from a diagnostic sample from a neonatal pig diarrhea case and identified by using metagenomics and complete genome sequencing. The viral genome shares 75.4% nucleotide identity with a prototypic EVG strain (PEV9 UKG/410/73). Remarkably, a 582-nucleotide insertion, flanked by 3Cpro cleavage sites at the 5' and 3' ends, was found in the 2C/3A junction region of the viral genome. This insertion encodes a predicted protease with 54 to 68% amino acid identity to torovirus (ToV) papain-like protease (PLP) (ToV-PLP). Structural homology modeling predicts that this protease adopts a fold and a catalytic site characteristic of minimal PLP catalytic domains. This structure is similar to those of core catalytic domains of the foot-and-mouth disease virus leader protease and coronavirus PLPs, which act as deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon [IFN]-stimulated gene 15 [ISG15]-removing) enzymes on host cell substrates. Importantly, the recombinant ToV-PLP protein derived from this novel enterovirus also showed strong deubiquitination and deISGylation activities and demonstrated the ability to suppress IFN-beta expression. Using reverse genetics, we generated a ToV-PLP knockout recombinant virus. Compared to the wild-type virus, the ToV-PLP knockout mutant virus showed impaired growth and induced higher expression levels of innate immune genes in infected cells. These results suggest that ToV-PLP functions as an innate immune antagonist; enterovirus G may therefore gain fitness through the acquisition of ToV-PLP from a recombination event.
   IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses comprise a highly diversified group of viruses. Genetic recombination has been considered a driving force for viral evolution; however, recombination between viruses from two different orders is a rare event. In this study, we identified a special case of cross-order recombination between enterovirus G (order Picornavirales) and torovirus (order Nidovirales). This naturally occurring recombination event may have broad implications for other picornaviral and/or nidoviral species. Importantly, we demonstrated that the exogenous ToV-PLP gene that was inserted into the EVG genome encodes a deubiquitinase/deISGylase and potentially suppresses host cellular innate immune responses. Our results provide insights into how a gain of function through genetic recombination, in particular cross-order recombination, may improve the ability of a virus to evade host immunity.

AB Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency within the sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (TG). HSV-specific memory CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in preventing HSV-1 reactivation from TG and subsequent virus shedding in tears that trigger recurrent corneal herpetic disease. The CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10)/CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) chemokine pathway promotes T cell immunity to many viral pathogens, but its importance in CD8(+) T cell immunity to recurrent herpes has been poorly elucidated. In this study, we determined how the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway affects TG- and cornea-resident CD8(+) T cell responses to recurrent ocular herpesvirus infection and disease using a well-established murine model in which HSV-1 reactivation was induced from latently infected TG by UV-B light. Following UV-B-induced HSV-1 reactivation, a significant increase in both the number and function of HSV-specific CXCR3(+) CD8(+) T cells was detected in TG and corneas of protected C57BL/6 (B6) mice, but not in TG and corneas of nonprotected CXCL10(-/-) or CXCR3(-/-) deficient mice. This increase was associated with a significant reduction in both virus shedding and recurrent corneal herpetic disease. Furthermore, delivery of exogenous CXCL10 chemokine in TG of CXCL10(-/-) mice, using the neurotropic adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8) vector, boosted the number and function of effector memory CD8(+) T cells (T-EM) and tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cells (T-RM), but not of central memory CD8(+) T cells (T-CM), locally within TG, and improved protection against recurrent herpesvirus infection and disease in CXCL10(-/-) deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that the CXCL10/CXCR3 chemokine pathway is critical in shaping CD8(+) T cell immunity, locally within latently infected tissues, which protects against recurrent herpesvirus infection and disease.
   IMPORTANCE We determined how the CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway affects CD8(+) T cell responses to recurrent ocular herpesvirus infection and disease. Using a well-established murine model, in which HSV-1 reactivation in latently infected trigeminal ganglia was induced by UV-B light, we demonstrated that lack of either CXCL10 chemokine or its CXCR3 receptor compromised the mobilization of functional CD8(+) T-EM and CD8(+) T-RM cells within latently infected trigeminal ganglia following virus reactivation. This lack of T cell mobilization was associated with an increase in recurrent ocular herpesvirus infection and disease. Inversely, augmenting the amount of CXCL10 in trigeminal ganglia of latently infected CXCL10-deficient mice significantly restored the number of local antiviral CD8(+) T-EM and CD8(+) T-RM cells associated with protection against recurrent ocular herpes. Based on these findings, a novel "prime/pull" therapeutic ocular herpes vaccine strategy is proposed and discussed.

AB The molecular mechanisms underlying chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are poorly characterized. In this study, we analyzed the host factors involved in CHIKV infection using genome-wide screening. Human haploid HAP1 cells, into which an exon-trapping vector was introduced, were challenged with a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype bearing the CHIKV E3 to El envelope proteins. Analysis of genes enriched in the cells resistant to the pseudotyped virus infection unveiled a critical role of N-sulfation of heparan sulfate (HS) for the infectivity of the clinically isolated CHIKV Thai#16856 strain to HAP1 cells. Knockout of NDST1 that catalyzes N-sulfation of HS greatly decreased the binding and infectivity of CHIKV Thai#16856 strain but not infectivity of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). While glycosaminoglycans were commonly required for the efficient infectivity of CHIKV, JEV, and YFV, as shown by using B3GAT3 knockout cells, the tropism for N-sulfate was specific to CHIKV. Expression of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in NOSTI-knockout HAP1 cells did not restore the binding of CHIKV Thai#16856 strain and the infectivity of its pseudotype but restored the infectivity of authentic CHIKV Thai#16856, suggesting that CS functions at later steps after CHIKV binding. Among the genes enriched in this screening, we found that TM9SF2 is critical for N-sulfation of HS and therefore for CHIKV infection because it is involved in the proper localization and stability of NDST1. Determination of the significance of and the relevant proteins to N-sulfation of HS may contribute to understanding mechanisms of CHIKV propagation, cell tropism, and pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Recent outbreaks of chikungunya fever have increased its clinical importance. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) utilizes host glycosaminoglycans to bind efficiently to its target cells. However, the substructure in glycosaminoglycans required for [HM/infection have not been characterized. Here, we unveil that N-sulfate in heparan sulfate is essential for the efficient infection of a clinical CHIKV strain to HAP1 cells and that chondroitin sulfate does not help the CHIKV binding but does play roles at the later steps in HAP1 cells. We show, by comparing previous reports using Chinese hamster ovary cells, along with another observation that enhanced infectivity of CHIKV bearing Arg82 in envelope E2 does not depend on glycosaminoglycans in HAP1 cells, that the infection manner of CHIKV varies among host cells. We also show that TM9SF2 is required for CHIKV infection to HAP1 cells because it is involved in the N-sulfation of heparan sulfate through ensuring NDST1 activity.

AB Equine arteritis virus (EAV) has a global impact on the equine industry as the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA), a respiratory, systemic, and reproductive disease of equids. A distinctive feature of EAV infection is that it establishes long-term persistent infection in 10 to 70% of infected stallions (carriers). In these stallions, EAV is detectable only in the reproductive tract, and viral persistence occurs despite the presence of high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Carrier stallions constitute the natural reservoir of the virus as they continuously shed EAV in their semen. Although the accessory sex glands have been implicated as the primary sites of EAV persistence, the viral host cell tropism and whether viral replication in carrier stallions occurs in the presence or absence of host inflammatory responses remain unknown. In this study, dual immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence techniques were employed to unequivocally demonstrate that the ampulla is the main EAV tissue reservoir rather than immunologically privileged tissues (i.e., testes). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EAV has specific tropism for stromal cells (fibrocytes and possibly tissue macrophages) and CD8(+) T and CD21 B lymphocytes but not glandular epithelium. Persistent EAV infection is associated with moderate, multifocal lymphoplasmacytic ampullitis comprising clusters of B (CD21) lymphocytes and significant infiltration of T (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD25(+)) lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells (lba-1(+) and CD83(+)), with a small number of tissue macrophages expressing CD163 and CD204 scavenger receptors. This study suggests that EAV employs complex immune evasion mechanisms that warrant further investigation.
   IMPORTANCE The major challenge for the worldwide control of EAV is that this virus has the distinctive ability to establish persistent infection in the stallion's reproductive tract as a mechanism to ensure its maintenance in equid populations. Therefore, the precise identification of tissue and cellular tropism of EAV is critical for understanding the molecular basis of viral persistence and for development of improved prophylactic or treatment strategies. This study significantly enhances our understanding of the EAV carrier state in stallions by unequivocally identifying the ampullae as the primary sites of viral persistence, combined with the fact that persistence involves continuous viral replication in fibrocytes (possibly including tissue macrophages) and T and B lymphocytes in the presence of detectable inflammatory responses, suggesting the involvement of complex viral mechanisms of immune evasion. Therefore, EAV persistence provides a powerful new natural animal model to study RNA virus persistence in the male reproductive tract.

AB Cytomegalovirus (CMV) entry into fibroblasts differs from entry into epithelial cells. CMV also spreads cell to cell and can induce syncytia. To gain insights into these processes, 27 antibodies targeting epitopes in CMV virion glycoprotein complexes, including glycoprotein B(gB) gH/gL, and the pentamer, were evaluated for their effects on viral entry and spread. No antibodies inhibited CMV spread in fibroblasts, including those with potent neutralizing activity against fibroblast entry, while all antibodies that neutralized epithelial cell entry also inhibited spread in epithelial cells and a correlation existed between the potencies of these two activities. This suggests that exposure of virions to the cell culture medium is obligatory during spread in epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts. In fibroblasts, the formation of syncytiumlike structures was impaired not only by antibodies to gB or gH/gL but also by antibodies to the pentamer, suggesting a potential role for the pentamer in promoting fibroblast fusion. Four antibodies reacted with linear epitopes near the N terminus of gH, exhibited strain specificity, and neutralized both epithelial cell and fibroblast entry. Five other antibodies recognized conformational epitopes in gH/gL and neutralized both fibroblast and epithelial cell entry. That these antibodies were strain specific for neutralizing fibroblast but not epithelial cell entry suggests that polymorphisms external to certain gH/gL epitopes may influence antibody neutralization during fibroblast but not epithelial cell entry. These findings may have implications for elucidating the mechanisms of CMV entry, spread, and antibody evasion and may assist in determining which antibodies may be most efficacious following active immunization or passive administration.
   IMPORTANCE Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of birth defects among newborns infected in utero and morbidity and mortality in transplant and AIDS patients. Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting humoral responses are under development for prophylactic or therapeutic use. The findings reported here (i) confirm that cell-to-cell spread of CMV is sensitive to antibody inhibition in epithelial cells but not fibroblasts, (ii) demonstrate that antibodies can restrict the formation in vitro of syncytiumlike structures that resemble syncytial cytomegalic cells that are associated with CMV disease in vivo, and (iii) reveal that neutralization of CMV by antibodies to certain epitopes in gH or gH/gL is both strain and cell type dependent and can be governed by polymorphisms in sequences external to the epitopes. These findings serve to elucidate the mechanisms of CMV entry, spread, and antibody evasion and may have important implications for the development of CMV vaccines and immunotherapeutics.

AB As its name suggests, the host receptor herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) facilitates herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry through interactions with a viral envelope glycoprotein. HVEM also bridges several signaling networks, binding ligands from both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamilies with diverse, and often opposing, outcomes. While HVEM was first identified as a viral entry receptor for HSV, it is only recently that HVEM has emerged as an important host factor in immunopathogenesis of ocular HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection. Surprisingly, HVEM exacerbates disease development in the eye independently of entry. HVEM signaling has been shown to play a variety of roles in modulating immune responses to HSV and other pathogens, and there is increasing evidence that these effects are responsible for HVEM-mediated pathogenesis in the eye. Here, we review the dual branches of HVEM function during HSV infection: entry and immunomodulation. HVEM is broadly expressed; intersects two important immunologic signaling networks; and impacts autoimmunity, infection, and inflammation. We hope that by understanding the complex range of effects mediated by this receptor, we can offer insights applicable to a wide variety of disease states.

AB Glycosylation of Env defines pathogenic properties of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We previously demonstrated that pathogenic SlVmac239 and a live-attenuated, quintuple deglycosylated Env mutant (Delta 5G) virus target CD4(+) T cells residing in different tissues during acute infection. SlVmac239 and A5G preferentially infected distinct CD4(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and within the lamina propria of the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86: 9323-9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00948-12). Here, we studied the host responses relevant to SIV targeting of CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells in SLOs. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that Th1-polarized inflammatory responses, defined by expression of CXCR3 chemokines, were distinctly induced in the SlVmac239-infected animals. Consistent with robust expression of CXCL10, CXCR3(+) T cells were depleted from blood in the SlVmac239-infected animals. We also discovered that elevation of CXCL10 expression in blood and SLOs was secondary to the induction of CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages, respectively. Since the significantly higher levels of SIV infection in SLOs occurred with a massive accumulation of infiltrated MAC387(+) macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and residential macrophages near high endothelial venules, the results highlight critical roles of innate/inflammatory responses in SlVmac239 infection. Restricted infection in SLOs by A5G also suggests that glycosylation of Env modulates innate/inflammatory responses elicited by cells of monocyte/macrophage/DC lineages.
   IMPORTANCE We previously demonstrated that a pathogenic SlVmac239 virus and a live-attenuated, deglycosylated mutant A5G virus infected distinct CD4(+) T cell subsets in SLOs and the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86:9323-9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI,00948-12). Accordingly, infections with SlVmac239, but not with A5G, deplete CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T (Th1) cells during the primary infection, thereby compromising the cellular immune response. Thus, we hypothesized that distinct host responses are elicited by the infections with two different viruses. We found that SlVmac239 induced distinctly higher levels of inflammatory Th1 responses than Delta 5G. In particular, SlVmac239 infection elicited robust expression of CXCL10, a chemokine for CXCR3(+) cells, in CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages recently infiltrated in SLOs. In contrast, Delta 5G infection elicited only modest inflammatory responses. These results suggest that the glycosylation of Env modulates the inflammatory/Th1 responses through the monocyte/macrophage subsets and elicits marked differences in SIV infection and clinical outcomes.

AB Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) infect and establish latency in peripheral neurons, from which they can reactivate to cause recurrent disease throughout the life of the host. Stress is associated with the exacerbation of clinical symptoms and the induction of recurrences in humans and animal models. The viruses preferentially replicate and establish latency in different subtypes of sensory neurons, as well as in neurons of the autonomic nervous system that are highly responsive to stress hormones. To determine if stress-related hormones modulate productive HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections within sensory and autonomic neurons, we analyzed viral DNA and the production of viral progeny after treatment of primary adult murine neuronal cultures with the stress hormones epinephrine and corticosterone. Both sensory trigeminal ganglion (TG) and sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons expressed adrenergic receptors (activated by epinephrine) and the glucocorticoid receptor (activated by corticosterone). Productive HSV infection colocalized with these receptors in SCG but not in TG neurons. In productively infected neuronal cultures, epinephrine treatment significantly increased the levels of HSV-1 DNA replication and production of viral progeny in SCG neurons, but no significant differences were found in TG neurons. In contrast, corticosterone significantly decreased the levels of HSV-2 DNA replication and production of viral progeny in SCG neurons but not in TG neurons. Thus, the stress-related hormones epinephrine and corticosterone selectively modulate acute HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in autonomic, but not sensory, neurons.
   IMPORTANCE Stress exacerbates acute disease symptoms resulting from HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections and is associated with the appearance of recurrent skin lesions in millions of people. Although stress hormones are thought to impact HSV-1 and HSV-2 through immune system suppression, sensory and autonomic neurons that become infected by HSV-1 and HSV-2 express stress hormone receptors and are responsive to hormone fluctuations. Our results show that autonomic neurons are more responsive to epinephrine and corticosterone than are sensory neurons, demonstrating that the autonomic nervous system plays a substantial role in HSV pathogenesis. Furthermore, these results suggest that stress responses have the potential to differentially impact HSV-1 and HSV-2 so as to produce divergent outcomes of infection.

TI Subtype-Specific Differences in Gag-Protease-Driven Replication Capacity
   Are Consistent with Intersubtype Differences in HIV-1 Disease

AB There are marked differences in the spread and prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide, and differences in clinical progression have been reported. However, the biological reasons underlying these differences are unknown. Gag-protease is essential for HIV-1 replication, and Gag-protease-driven replication capacity has previously been correlated with disease progression. We show that Gag-protease replication capacity correlates significantly with that of whole isolates (r = 0.51; P = 0.04), indicating that Gag-protease is a significant contributor to viral replication capacity. Furthermore, we investigated subtype-specific differences in Gag-protease driven replication capacity using large well-characterized cohorts in Africa and the Americas. Patient-derived Gag-protease sequences were inserted into an HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone, and the replication capacities of the resulting recombinant viruses were measured in an HIV-1-inducible reporter T cell line by flow cytometry. Recombinant viruses expressing subtype C Gag-proteases exhibited substantially lower replication capacities than those expressing subtype B Gag-proteases (P < 0.0001); this observation remained consistent when representative Gag-protease sequences were engineered into an HIV-1 subtype C backbone. We identified Gag residues 483 and 484, located within the Alix-binding motif involved in virus budding, as major contributors to subtype-specific replicative differences. In East African cohorts, we observed a hierarchy of Gag-protease-driven replication capacities, i.e., subtypes A/C < D < intersubtype recombinants (P < 0.0029), which is consistent with reported intersubtype differences in disease progression. We thus hypothesize that the lower Gag protease-driven replication capacity of subtypes A and C slows disease progression in individuals infected with these subtypes, which in turn leads to greater opportunity for transmission and thus increased prevalence of these subtypes.
   IMPORTANCE HIV-1 subtypes are unevenly distributed globally, and there are reported differences in their rates of disease progression and epidemic spread. The biological determinants underlying these differences have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that HIV-1 Gag-protease-driven replication capacity correlates with the replication capacity of whole virus isolates. We further show that subtype B displays a significantly higher Gag-protease-mediated replication capacity than does subtype C, and we identify a major genetic determinant of these differences. Moreover, in two independent East African cohorts we demonstrate a reproducible hierarchy of Gag-protease-driven replicative capacity, whereby recombinants exhibit the greatest replication, followed by subtype D, followed by subtypes A and C. Our data identify Gag-protease as a major determinant of subtype differences in disease progression among HIV-1 subtypes; furthermore, we propose that the poorer viral replicative capacity of subtypes A and C may paradoxically contribute to their more efficient spread in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Encapsidation of genetic material into polyhedral particles is one of the most common structural solutions employed by viruses infecting hosts in all three domains of life. Here, we describe a new virus of hyperthermophilic archaea, Sulfolobus polyhedral virus 1 (SPV1), which condenses its circular double-stranded DNA genome in a manner not previously observed for other known viruses. The genome complexed with virion proteins is wound up sinusoidally into a spherical coil which is surrounded by an envelope and further encased by an outer polyhedral capsid apparently composed of the 20-kDa virion protein. Lipids selectively acquired from the pool of host lipids are integral constituents of the virion. None of the major virion proteins of SPV1 show similarity to structural proteins of known viruses. However, minor structural proteins, which are predicted to mediate host recognition, are shared with other hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses infecting members of the order Sulfolobales. The SPV1 genome consists of 20,222 bp and contains 45 open reading frames, only one-fifth of which could be functionally annotated.
   IMPORTANCE Viruses infecting hyperthermophilic archaea display a remarkable morphological diversity, often presenting architectural solutions not employed by known viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes. Here we present the isolation and characterization of Sulfolobus polyhedral virus 1, which condenses its genome into a unique spherical coil. Due to the original genomic and architectural features of SPV1, the virus should be considered a representative of a new viral family, "Portogloboviridae."

AB Viral factories are compartmentalized centers for viral replication and assembly in infected eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the formation of a replication focus by prototypical archaeal Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) in the model archaeon Suifolobus. This rod-shaped virus belongs to the viral family Rudiviridoe, carrying linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes, which are very common in geothermal environments. We demonstrate that SIRV2 DNA synthesis is confined to a focus near the periphery of infected cells. Moreover, viral and cellular replication proteins are recruited to, and concentrated in, the viral replication focus. Furthermore, we show that of the four host DNA polymerases (DNA polymerase I [Dpol] to Dpo4), only Dpol participates in viral DNA synthesis. This constitutes the first report of the formation of a viral replication focus in archaeal cells, suggesting that organization of viral replication in foci is a widespread strategy employed by viruses of the three domains of life.
   IMPORTANCE The organization of viral replication in foci or viral factories has been mostly described for different eukaryotic viruses and for several bacteriophages. This work constitutes the first report of the formation of a viral replication center by a virus infecting members of the Archaea domain.

AB Baculoviruses encode a variety of auxiliary proteins that are not essential for viral replication but provide them with a selective advantage in nature. P10 is a 10-kDa auxiliary protein produced in the very late phase of gene transcription by Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The P10 protein forms cytoskeleton-like structures in the host cell that associate with microtubules varying from filamentous forms in the cytoplasm to aggregated perinuclear tubules that form a cage-like structure around the nucleus. These P10 structures may have a role in the release of occlusion bodies (OBs) and thus mediate the horizontal transmission of the virus between insect hosts. Here, using mass spectrometric analysis, it is demonstrated that the C terminus of P10 is phosphorylated during virus infection of cells in culture. Analysis of P10 mutants encoded by recombinant baculoviruses in which putative phosphorylation residues were mutated to alanine showed that serine 93 is a site of phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy examination of the serine 93 mutant structures revealed aberrant formation of the perinuclear tubules. Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 93 may induce the aggregation of filaments to form tubules. Together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of serine 93 affects the structural conformation of P10.
   IMPORTANCE The baculovirus P10 protein has been researched intensively since it was first observed in 1969, but its role during viral infection remains unclear. It is conserved in the alphabaculoviruses and expressed at high levels during virus infection. Producing large amounts of a protein is wasteful for the virus unless it is advantageous for the survival of its progeny, and therefore, P10 presents an enigma. As P10 polymerizes to form organized cytoskeletal structures that colocalize with host cell microtubules, the structural relationship of the protein with the host cell may present a key to help understand the function and importance of this protein. This study addresses the importance of the structural changes in P10 during infection and how they may be governed by phosphorylation. The P10 structures affected by phosphorylation are closely associated with the viral progeny and thus may potentially be responsible for its dissemination and survival.

TI Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Disrupts Adaptive Immune Responses

AB Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient.
   IMPORTANCE HIV patients who interrupt combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) eventually experience viral rebound, the return of viral loads to pretreatment levels. However, the "Berlin patient" remained free of HIV rebound over a decade after stopping cART. His cure is attributed to leukemia treatment that included an HIV-resistant stem cell transplant. Inspired by this case, we studied the impact of stem cell transplantation in a macaque simian/HIV (SHIV) system. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we found that while primary infection generates an adaptive immune memory response, stem cell transplantation disrupts this learned immunity. The results have implications for HIV cure regimens based on stem cell transplantation.

AB The bacteriophage phi 29 infects Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis with a short noncontractile tail. Recent studies showed that the phi 29 tail protein gp9 forms a hexameric tube with six long loops of membrane-active peptides blocking in the tube at the distal end of the tail. The long loops exit on genome release and form a membrane pore for passage of the genome. The membrane penetration mechanism of the phi 29 tail might be common among tailed bacteriophages.

   LTR; IDENTIFICATION
AB A dynamic actin cytoskeleton is necessary for viral entry, intracellular migration, and virion release. For HIV-1 infection, during entry, the virus triggers early actin activity by hijacking chemokine coreceptor signaling, which activates a host dependency factor, cofilin, and its kinase, the LIM domain kinase (LIMK). Although knockdown of human LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibits HIV infection, no specific small-molecule inhibitor of LIMK has been available. Here, we describe the design and discovery of novel classes of small molecule inhibitors of LIMK for inhibiting HIV infection. We identified R10015 as a lead compound that blocks LIMK activity by binding to the ATP-binding pocket. R10015 specifically blocks viral DNA synthesis, nuclear migration, and virion release. In addition, R10015 inhibits multiple viruses, including Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and herpes simplex virus 1 (H5V-1), suggesting that LIMK inhibitors could be developed as a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
   IMPORTANCE The actin cytoskeleton is a structure that gives the cell shape and the ability to migrate. Viruses frequently rely on actin dynamics for entry and intracellular migration. In cells, actin dynamics are regulated by kinases, such as the LIM domain kinase (LIMK), which regulates actin activity through phosphorylation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor. Recent studies have found that LIMK/cofilin are targeted by viruses such as HIV-1 for propelling viral intracellular migration. Although inhibiting LIMK1 expression blocks HIV-1 infection, no highly specific LIMK inhibitor is available. This study describes the design, medicinal synthesis, and discovery of small-molecule LIMK inhibitors for blocking HIV-1 and several other viruses and emphasizes the feasibility of developing LIMK inhibitors as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.

AB Gammaherpesviruses are important human and animal pathogens. Infection control has proven difficult because the key process of transmission is ill understood. Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4), a gammaherpesvirus of mice, is transmitted sexually. We show that this depends on the major virion envelope glycoprotein gp150. gp150 is redundant for host entry, and in vitro, it regulates rather than promotes cell binding. We show that gp150-deficient MuHV-4 reaches and replicates normally in the female genital tract after nasal infection but is poorly released from vaginal epithelial cells and fails to pass from the female to the male genital tract during sexual contact. Thus, we show that the regulation of virion binding is a key component of spontaneous gammaherpesvirus transmission.
   IMPORTANCE Gammaherpesviruses are responsible for many important diseases in both animals and humans. Some important aspects of their life cycle are still poorly understood. Key among these is viral transmission. Here we show that the major envelope glycoprotein of murid herpesvirus 4 functions not in entry or dissemination but in virion release to allow sexual transmission to new hosts.

AB Coxsackievirus A10 (CVA10) is one of the major pathogens associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). CVA10 infection can cause herpangina and viral pneumonia, which can be complicated by severe neurological sequelae. The morbidity and mortality of CVA10-associated HFMD have been increasing in recent years, particularly in the pan-Pacific region. There are limited studies, however, on the pathogenesis and immunology of CVA10-associated HFMD infections, and few antiviral drugs or vaccines have been reported. In the present study, a cell adapted CVA10 strain was employed to inoculate intramuscularly 5-day-old ICR mice, which developed significant clinical signs, including reduced mobility, lower weight gain, and quadriplegia, with significant pathology in the brain, hind limb skeletal muscles, and lungs of infected mice in the moribund state. The severity of illness was associated with abnormally high expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Antiviral assays demonstrated that ribavirin and gamma interferon administration could significantly inhibit CVA10 replication both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, formaldehyde-inactivated CVA10 whole-virus vaccines induced immune responses in adult mice, and maternal neutralizing antibodies could be transmitted to neonatal mice, providing protection against CVA10 clinical strains. Furthermore, high-titer antisera were effective against CVA10 and could relieve early clinical symptoms and improve the survival rates of CVA10-challenged neonatal mice. In summary, we present a novel murine model to study CVA10 pathology that will be extremely useful in developing effective antivirals and vaccines to diminish the burden of HFMD-associated disease.
   IMPORTANCE Hand, foot, and mouth disease cases in infancy, arising from coxsackievirus A10 (CVA10) infections, are typically benign, resolving without any significant adverse events. Severe disease and fatalities, however, can occur in some children, necessitating the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies. The present study has established a newborn-mouse model of CVA10 that, importantly, recapitulates many aspects of human disease with respect to the neuropathology and skeletal muscle pathology. We found that high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 correlated with disease severity and that ribavirin and gamma interferon could decrease viral titers in vitro and in vivo. Whole-virus vaccines produced immune responses in adult mice, and immunized mothers conferred protection on neonates against challenge from CVA10 clinical strains. Passive immunization with high-titer antisera could also improve survival rates in newborn animals.

TI Understanding the Mechanism of the Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity of

AB Favipiravir (T-705) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has been approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections. T-705 also inhibits the replication of various RNA viruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We demonstrated earlier that the K291R mutation in the F1 motif of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of CHIKV is responsible for low-level resistance to T-705. Interestingly, this lysine is highly conserved in the RdRp of positive-sense singlestranded RNA (+ ssRNA) viruses. To obtain insights into the unique broad-spectrum antiviral activity of T-705, we explored the role of this lysine using another +ssRNA virus, namely, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Introduction of the corresponding K-to-R substitution in the CVB3 RdRp (K159R) resulted in a nonviable virus. Replication competence of the K159R variant was restored by spontaneous acquisition of an A239G substitution in the RdRp. A mutagenesis analysis at position K159 identified the K159M variant as the only other viable variant which had also acquired the A239G substitution. The K159 substitutions markedly decreased the processivity of the purified viral RdRp, which was restored by the introduction of the A239G mutation. The K159R A239G and K159M A239G variants proved, surprisingly, more susceptible than the wild-type virus to T-705 and exhibited lower fidelity in polymerase assays. Furthermore, the K159R A239G variant was found to be highly attenuated in mice. We thus demonstrate that the conserved lysine in the F1 motif of the RdRp of +ssRNA viruses is involved in the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of T-705 and that it is a key amino acid for the proper functioning of the enzyme.
   IMPORTANCE In this study, we report the key role of a highly conserved lysine residue of the viral polymerase in the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of favipiravir (T705) against positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Substitutions of this conserved lysine have a major negative impact on the functionality of the RdRp. Furthermore, we show that this lysine is involved in the fidelity of the RdRp and that the RdRp fidelity influences the sensitivity of the virus for the antiviral efficacy of T-705. Consequently, these results provide insights into the mechanism of the antiviral activity of T-705 and may lay the basis for the design of novel chemical scaffolds that may be endowed with a more potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity than that of T-705.

AB Influenza A virus matrix protein 1 (M1) is an essential component involved in the structural stability of the virus and in the budding of new virions from infected cells. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis of virion formation and the budding process is required in order to devise new therapeutic approaches. We performed a detailed investigation of the interaction between M1 and phosphatidylserine (PS) (i.e., its main binding target at the plasma membrane [PM]), as well as the distribution of PS itself, both in model membranes and in living cells. To this end, we used a combination of techniques, including Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), confocal microscopy imaging, raster image correlation spectroscopy, and number and brightness (N&B) analysis. Our results show that PS can cluster in segregated regions in the plane of the lipid bilayer, both in model bilayers constituted of PS and phosphatidylcholine and in living cells. The viral protein M1 interacts specifically with PS-enriched domains, and such interaction in turn affects its oligomerization process. Furthermore, M1 can stabilize PS domains, as observed in model membranes. For living cells, the presence of PS clusters is suggested by N&B experiments monitoring the clustering of the PS sensor lactadherin. Also, colocalization between M1 and a fluorescent PS probe suggest that, in infected cells, the matrix protein can specifically bind to the regions of PM in which PS is clustered. Taken together, our observations provide novel evidence regarding the role of PS-rich domains in tuning M1-lipid and M1-M1 interactions at the PM of infected cells.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza virus particles assemble at the plasma membranes (PM) of infected cells. This process is orchestrated by the matrix protein M1, which interacts with membrane lipids while binding to the other proteins and genetic material of the virus. Despite its importance, the initial step in virus assembly (i.e., M1-lipid interaction) is still not well understood. In this work, we show that phosphatidylserine can form lipid domains in physical models of the inner leaflet of the PM. Furthermore, the spatial organization of PS in the plane of the bilayer modulates M1-M1 interactions. Finally, we show that PS domains appear to be present in the PM of living cells and that M1 seems to display a high affinity for them.

TI Cbl E3 Ligase Mediates the Removal of Nectin-1 from the Surface of

AB The Cbl E3 ligase has been linked to the down-modulation of surface signaling responses by inducing internalization of surface receptors. The adaptor protein CIN85 is a partner of Cbl that augments many of these interactions. Previously, an interaction was demonstrated between ICP0 and CIN85, which results in the removal of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from the surface of the infected cells with a concomitant attenuation of EGFR signaling. Here, we examined whether Cbl mediates the removal of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry receptor Nectin-1 from the surface of infected cells. We found the following: (i) that Cbl, Nectin-1, and the viral glycoprotein D (gD) form a complex in infected cells; (ii) that during infection Nectin-1 is removed from the surface of the infected cells but is retained on the surface of cells that have been depleted of Cbl; and (iii) that in cells infected with a Delta ICP0 mutant virus, Nectin-1 remained on the cell surface. Thus, Cbl is necessary but not sufficient for the removal of Nectin-1 from the cell surface. In addition, we observed that in Cbl-depleted cells there was enhanced entry after infection. These cells were susceptible to secondary infections by HSV-1. Viral entry in CIN85-depleted cells was only moderately enhanced compared to that in the Cbl-depleted cells, suggesting that the Cbl-Nectin-1 interaction is likely the key to the downregulation of surface Nectin-1. The removal of the HSV-1 entry receptor Nectin-1 from the surface of the infected cells may be part of the strategy of the virus to efficiently spread to uninfected cells.
   IMPORTANCE The Cbl E3 ligase suppresses surface signaling responses by inducing internalization of surface components. The targets of Cbl include such components as immune system receptors, growth factor receptors, adhesion, and cell-to-cell contact molecules. The immediate early protein ICP0 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) interacts with CIN85, an adaptor protein that augments Cbl functions. The consequence of this interaction is the removal of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from the surface of the infected cells with concomitant suppression of the EGF ligand signaling. The viral entry receptor Nectin-1 is also internalized during HSV-1 infection in a Cbl-dependent mechanism, and that increases the opportunity of the virus to spread to uninfected cells. The diversion of the Cbl/CIN85 endocytic machinery may be a strategy utilized by the virus to alter the cell surface pattern to prevent detrimental host responses.

AB H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) has posed a potential threat to public health since its emergence in China in 2013. To understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 AIV in the avian population, we performed molecular surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, in central China, during 2014 and 2015. Wugang Prefecture is located on the Eastern Asian-Australian migratory bird flyway, and a human death due to an H5N6 virus was reported in the prefecture on 21 November 2016. In total, we sampled and sequenced the complete genomes of 175 H5N6 AIVs. Notably, our analysis revealed that H5N6 AIVs contain at least six genotypes arising from segment reassortment, including a rare variant that possesses an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene that has its origins with H7N3 viruses. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that genetically similar H5N6 AIVs tend to cluster according to their geographic regions of origin. These results help to reveal the evolutionary behavior of influenza viruses prior to their emergence in humans.
   IMPORTANCE The newly emerged H5N6 influenza A virus has caused more than 10 human deaths in China since 2013. In November 2016, a human death due to an H5N6 virus, in Wugang Prefecture, Hunan Province, was confirmed by the WHO. To better understand the evolution and emergence of H5N6 viruses, we surveyed live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wugang Prefecture before the reported human death, with a focus on revealing the diversity and genomic origins of H5N6 in birds during 2014 and 2015. In general, H5N6 viruses in this region were most closely related to H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4, with the exception of one virus with an HA gene derived from clade 2.3.2 such that it represents a novel reassortant. Clearly, the ongoing surveillance of LPMs is central to monitoring the emergence of pathogenic influenza viruses.

AB Membrane penetration by nonenveloped viruses remains enigmatic. In the case of the nonenveloped polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40), the virus penetrates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to reach the cytosol and then traffics to the nucleus to cause infection. We previously demonstrated that the cytosolic Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 complex is tethered to the ER membrane, where Hsp105 and SGTA facilitate the extraction of SV40 from the ER and transport of the virus into the cytosol. We now find that Hsc70 also ejects SV40 from the ER into the cytosol in a step regulated by SGTA. Although SGTA's N-terminal domain, which mediates homodimerization and recruits cellular adaptors, is dispensable during ER-to-cytosol transport of SV40, this domain appears to exert an unexpected post-ER membrane translocation function during SV40 entry. Our study thus establishes a critical function of Hsc70 within the Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 complex in promoting SV40 ER-to-cytosol membrane penetration and unveils a role of SGTA in controlling this step.
   IMPORTANCE How a nonenveloped virus transports across a biological membrane to cause infection remains mysterious. One enigmatic step is whether host cytosolic components are co-opted to transport the viral particle into the cytosol. During ERto-cytosol membrane transport of the nonenveloped polyomavirus SV40, a decisive infection step, a cytosolic complex composed of Hsc70-SGTA-Hsp105 was previously shown to associate with the ER membrane. SGTA and Hsp105 have been shown to extract SV40 from the ER and transport the virus into the cytosol. We demonstrate here a critical role of Hsc70 in SV40 ER-to-cytosol penetration and reveal how SGTA controls Hsc70 to impact this process.

AB Parvoviruses use a variety of means to control the expression of their compact genomes. The bocaparvovirus minute virus of canines (MVC) encodes a small, genus-specific protein, NP1, which governs access to the viral capsid gene via its role in alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing of the single MVC pre-mRNA. In addition to NP1, MVC encodes five additional nonstructural proteins (NS) that share an initiation codon at the left end of the genome and which are individually encoded by alternative multiply spliced mRNAs. We found that three of these proteins were encoded by mRNAs that excise the NP1-regulated MVC intron immediately upstream of the internal polyadenylation site, (pA)p, and that generation of these proteins was thus regulated by NP1. Splicing of their progenitor mRNAs joined the amino termini of these proteins to the NP1 open reading frame, and splice site mutations that prevented their expression inhibited virus replication in a host cell-dependent manner. Thus, in addition to controlling capsid gene access, NP1 also controls the expression of three of the five identified NS proteins via its role in governing MVC pre-mRNA splicing.
   IMPORTANCE The Parvovirinae are small nonenveloped icosahedral viruses that are important pathogens in many animal species, including humans. Minute virus of canine (MVC) is an autonomous parvovirus in the genus Bocaparvovirus. It has a single promoter that generates a single pre-mRNA. NP1, a small genus-specific MVC protein, participates in the processing of this pre-mRNA and so controls capsid gene access via its role in alternative internal polyadenylation and splicing. We show that NP1 also controls the expression of three of the five identified NS proteins via its role in governing MVC pre-mRNA splicing. These NS proteins together are required for virus replication in a host cell-dependent manner.

AB African swine fever virus (ASFV) codes for a putative histone-like protein (pA104R) with extensive sequence homology to bacterial proteins that are implicated in genome replication and packaging. Functional characterization of purified recombinant pA104R revealed that it binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) over a wide range of temperatures, pH values, and salt concentrations and in an ATP-independent manner, with an estimated binding site size of about 14 to 16 nucleotides. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the arginine located in pA104R's DNA-binding domain, at position 69, was found to be relevant for efficient DNA-binding activity. Together, pA104R and ASFV topoisomerase II (pP1192R) display DNA-supercoiling activity, although none of the proteins by themselves do, indicating that the two cooperate in this process. In ASFV-infected cells, A104R transcripts were detected from 2 h postinfection (hpi) onward, reaching a maximum concentration around 16 hpi. pA104R was detected from 12 hpi onward, localizing with viral DNA replication sites and being found exclusively in the Tritoninsoluble fraction. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments revealed that pA104R plays a critical role in viral DNA replication and gene expression, with transfected cells showing lower viral progeny numbers (up to a reduction of 82.0%), lower copy numbers of viral genomes (-78.3%), and reduced transcription of a late viral gene (-47.6%). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that pA104R participates in the modulation of viral DNA topology, probably being involved in viral DNA replication, transcription, and packaging, emphasizing that ASFV mutants lacking the A104R gene could be used as a strategy to develop a vaccine against ASFV.
   IMPORTANCE Recently reintroduced in Europe, African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a fatal disease in domestic pigs, causing high economic losses in affected countries, as no vaccine or treatment is currently available. Remarkably, ASFV is the only known mammalian virus that putatively codes for a histone-like protein (pA104R) that shares extensive sequence homology with bacterial histone-like proteins. In this study, we characterized the DNA-binding properties of pA104R, analyzed the functional importance of two conserved residues, and showed that pA104R and ASFV topoisomerase II cooperate and display DNA-supercoiling activity. Moreover, pA104R is expressed during the late phase of infection and accumulates in viral DNA replication sites, and its downregulation revealed that pA104R is required for viral DNA replication and transcription. These results suggest that pA104R participates in the modulation of viral DNA topology and genome packaging, indicating that A104R deletion mutants may be a good strategy for vaccine development against ASFV.

AB Bats are natural reservoirs for many pathogenic viruses, and increasing evidence supports the notion that bats can also harbor group A rotaviruses (RVAs), important causative agents of diarrhea in children and young animals. Currently, 8 RVA strains possessing completely novel genotype constellations or genotypes possibly originating from other mammals have been identified from African and Chinese bats. However, all the data were mainly based on detection of RVA RNA, present only during acute infections, which does not permit assessment of the true exposure of a bat population to RVA. To systematically investigate the genetic diversity of RVAs, 547 bat anal swabs or gut samples along with 448 bat sera were collected from five South Chinese provinces. Specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening found four RVA strains. Strain GLRL1 possessed a completely novel genotype constellation, whereas the other three possessed a constellation consistent with the MSLH14-like genotype, a newly characterized group of viruses widely prevalent in Chinese insectivorous bats. Among the latter, strain LZHP2 provided strong evidence of cross-species transmission of RVAs from bats to humans, whereas strains YSSK5 and BSTM70 were likely reassortants between typical MSLH14-like RVAs and human RVAs. RVA-specific antibodies were detected in 10.7% (48/448) of bat sera by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA). Bats in Guangxi and Yunnan had a higher RVA-specific antibody prevalence than those from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. These observations provide evidence for cross-species transmission of MSLH14-like bat RVAs to humans, highlighting the impact of bats as reservoirs of RVAs on public health.
   IMPORTANCE Bat viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses, are important pathogens causing outbreaks of severe emerging infectious diseases. However, little is known about bat viruses capable of causing gastroenteritis in humans, even though 8 group A viruses (RVAs) have been identified from bats so far. In this study, another 4 RVA strains were identified, with one providing strong evidence for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans. Serological investigation has also indicated that RVA infection in bats is far more prevalent than expected based on the detection of viral RNA.

AB Although a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine has been used for many years, the neuropathy caused by VZV infection is still a major health concern. Open reading frame 7 (ORF7) of VZV has been recognized as a neurotropic gene in vivo, but its neurovirulent role remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ORF7 deletion on VZV replication cycle at virus entry, genome replication, gene expression, capsid assembly and cytoplasmic envelopment, and transcellular transmission in differentiated neural progenitor cells (dNPCs) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (dSY5Y) cells. Our results demonstrate that the ORF7 protein is a component of the tegument layer of VZV virions. Deleting ORF7 did not affect viral entry, viral genome replication, or the expression of typical viral genes but clearly impacted cytoplasmic envelopment of VZV capsids, resulting in a dramatic increase of envelope-defective particles and a decrease in intact virions. The defect was more severe in differentiated neuronal cells of dNPCs and dSY5Y. ORF7 deletion also impaired transmission of ORF7-deficient virus among the neuronal cells. These results indicate that ORF7 is required for cytoplasmic envelopment of VZV capsids, virus transmission among neuronal cells, and probably the neuropathy induced by VZV infection.
   IMPORTANCE The neurological damage caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is commonly manifested as clinical problems. Thus, identifying viral neurovirulent genes and characterizing their functions are important for relieving VZV related neurological complications. ORF7 has been previously identified as a potential neurotropic gene, but its involvement in VZV replication is unclear. In this study, we found that ORF7 is required for VZV cytoplasmic envelopment in differentiated neuronal cells, and the envelopment deficiency caused by ORF7 deletion results in poor dissemination of VZV among neuronal cells. These findings imply that ORF7 plays a role in neuropathy, highlighting a potential strategy to develop a neurovirulence-attenuated vaccine against chickenpox and herpes zoster and providing a new target for intervention of neuropathy induced by VZV.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes enteric disease in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Current vaccination approaches against this emerging coronavirus are only partially effective, though natural infection protects pigs against reinfection and provides lactogenic immunity to suckling piglets. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein, responsible for receptor binding and cell entry, is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. However, knowledge of antibody epitopes, their nature and location in the spike structure, and the mechanisms by which the antibodies interfere with infection is scarce. Here we describe the generation and characterization of 10 neutralizing and nonneutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the S protein. By expression of different S1 protein fragments, six antibody epitope classes distributed over the five structural domains of the S1 subunit were identified. Characterization of antibodies for cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization revealed antigenic differences among PEDV strains. The epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies segregated into two epitope classes and mapped within the N-terminal sialic acid binding domain and in the more C-terminal receptor binding domain. Antibody neutralization escape mutants displayed single amino acid substitutions that impaired antibody binding and neutralization and defined the locations of the epitopes. Our observations picture the antibody epitope landscape of the PEDV S1 subunit and reveal that its cell attachment domains are key targets of neutralizing antibodies.
   IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging porcine coronavirus, causes an economically important enteric disease in pigs. Effective PEDV vaccines for disease control are currently lacking. The spike (S) glycoprotein on the virion surface is the key player in virus cell entry and, therefore, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the antigenic landscape of the PEDV spike protein, we developed monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein's S1 receptor binding region and characterized their epitopes, neutralizing activity, and cross-reactivity toward multiple PEDV strains. Epitopes of antibodies segregated into six epitope classes dispersed over the multidomain S1 structure. Monoclonal antibodies revealed antigenic variability in B-cell epitopes between PEDV strains. The epitopes of neutralizing antibodies mapped to two distinct domains in S1 that are involved in binding to carbohydrate and proteinaceous cell surface molecules, respectively, indicating the importance of these cell attachment sites on the PEDV spike protein in eliciting a protective humoral immune response.

AB The relative contributions of cell-free virion circulation and direct cell-to-cell transmission to retroviral dissemination and pathogenesis are unknown. Tetherin/Bst2 is an antiviral protein that blocks enveloped virion release into the extracellular milieu but may not inhibit cell-to-cell virus transmission. We developed live-cell imaging assays which show that tetherin does not affect Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) spread, and only minimally affects vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) spread, to adjacent cells in a monolayer. Conversely, cell-free MLV and VSV virion yields and VSV spread to distal cells were dramatically reduced by tetherin. To elucidate the roles of tetherin and cell-free virions during in vivo viral dissemination and pathogenesis, we developed mice carrying an inducible human tetherin (hTetherin) transgene. While ubiquitous hTetherin expression was detrimental to the growth and survival of mice, restriction of hTetherin expression to hematopoietic cells gave apparently healthy mice. The expression of hTetherin in hematopoietic cells had little or no effect on the number of MoMLV-infected splenocytes and thymocytes. However, hTetherin expression significantly reduced cell-free plasma viremia and also delayed MoMLVinduced disease. Overall, these results suggest that MoMLV spread within hematopoietic tissues and cell monolayers involves cell-to-cell transmission that is resistant to tetherin but that virion dissemination via plasma is inhibited by tetherin and is required for full MoMLV pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE Retroviruses are thought to spread primarily via direct cell-to-cell transmission, yet many have evolved to counteract an antiviral protein called tetherin, which may selectively inhibit cell-free virus release. We generated a mouse model with an inducible tetherin transgene in order to study how tetherin affects retroviral dissemination and on which cell types its expression is required to do so. We first developed a novel in vitro live-cell imaging assay to demonstrate that while tetherin does indeed dramatically reduce cell-free virus spreading, it has little to no effect on direct cell-to-cell transmission of either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or the retrovirus MoMLV. Using our transgenic mouse model, we found that tetherin expression on hematopoietic cells resulted in the specific reduction of MoMLV cell-free plasma viremia but not the number of infected hematopoietic cells. The delay in disease associated with this scenario suggests a role for cell-free virus in retroviral disease progression.

AB Vaccination remains the best option to combat equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) infection, and several different strategies of vaccination have been investigated and developed over the past few decades. Herein, we report that the live-attenuated herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) VC2 vaccine strain, which has been shown to be unable to enter into neurons and establish latency in mice, can be utilized as a vector for the heterologous expression of EHV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) and that the intramuscular immunization of mice results in strong antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. The VC2-EHV-1-gD recombinant virus was constructed by inserting an EHV-1 gD expression cassette under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter into the VC2 vector in place of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase (UL23) gene. The vaccines were introduced into mice through intramuscular injection. Vaccination with both the VC2-EHV-1-gD vaccine and the commercially available vaccine Vetera EHVXP 1/4 (Vetera; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica) resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies, the levels of which were significantly higher in comparison to those in VC2-and mock-vaccinated animals (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). Analysis of EHV-1-reactive IgG subtypes demonstrated that vaccination with the VC2-EHV-1-gD vaccine stimulated robust IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies after three vaccinations (P < 0.001). Interestingly, Vetera-vaccinated mice produced significantly higher levels of IgM than mice in the other groups before and after challenge (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Vaccination with VC2-EHV-1-gD stimulated strong cellular immune responses, characterized by the upregulation of both interferon-and tumor necrosis factor-positive CD4(broken vertical bar) T cells and CD8(broken vertical bar) T cells. Overall, the data suggest that the HSV-1 VC2 vaccine strain may be used as a viral vector for the vaccination of horses as well as, potentially, for the vaccination of other economically important animals.
   IMPORTANCE A novel virus-vectored VC2-EHV-1-gD vaccine was constructed using the live-attenuated HSV-1 VC2 vaccine strain. This vaccine stimulated strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, suggesting that it could protect horses against EHV-1 infection.

AB Human adenoviral serotype 5 (HAdV-5) vectors have predominantly hepatic tropism when delivered intravascularly, resulting in immune activation and toxicity. Coagulation factor X (FX) binding to HAdV-5 mediates liver transduction and provides protection from virion neutralization in mice. FX is dispensable for liver transduction in mice lacking IgM antibodies or complement, suggesting that alternative transduction pathways exist. To identify novel factor(s) mediating HAdV-5 FX-independent entry, we investigated HAdV-5 transduction in vitro in the presence of serum from immunocompetent C57BL/6 or immunocompromised mice lacking IgM antibodies (Rag 2(-/-) and NOD-scid-gamma [NSG]). Sera from all three mouse strains enhanced HAdV-5 transduction of A549 cells. While inhibition of HAdV-5-FX interaction with FX-binding protein (X-bp) inhibited transduction in the presence of C57BL/6 serum, it had negligible effect on the enhanced transduction observed in the presence of Rag 2(-/-)or NSG serum. Rag 2(-/-) serum also enhanced transduction of the FX binding-deficient HAdV-5HVR5* HVR7* E451Q (AdT*). Interestingly, Rag 2(-/-)serum enhanced HAdV-5 transduction in a FX-independent manner in CHOCAR and SKOV3-CAR cells (CHO or SKOV3 cells transfected to stably express human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor [CAR]). Additionally, blockade of CAR with soluble HAdV-5 fiber knob inhibited mouse serum-enhanced transduction in A549 cells, suggesting a potential role for CAR. Transduction of HAdV-5 KO1 and HAdV-5/F35 (CAR binding deficient) in the presence of Rag 2(-/-)serum was equivalent to that of HAdV-5, indicating that direct interaction between HAdV-5 and CAR is not required. These data suggest that FX may protect HAdV-5 from neutralization but has minimal contribution to HAdV-5 transduction in the presence of immunocompromised mouse serum. Alternatively, transduction occurs via an unidentified mouse serum protein capable of bridging HAdV-5 to CAR.
   IMPORTANCE The intravascular administration of HAdV-5 vectors can result in acute liver toxicity, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and injury to the vascular endothelium, illustrating challenges yet to overcome for HAdV-5-mediated systemic gene therapy. The finding that CAR and potentially an unidentified factor present in mouse serum might be important mediators of HAdV-5 transduction highlights that a better understanding of the complex biology defining the interplay between adenovirus immune recognition and cellular uptake mechanisms is still required. These findings are important to inform future optimization and development of HAdV-5based adenoviral vectors for gene therapy.

AB Upon herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection, the CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) is redistributed around the nuclear membrane (NM), where it promotes viral de-envelopment during the nuclear egress of nucleocapsids. In this study, we attempted to identify the factor(s) involved in CD98hc accumulation and demonstrated the following: (i) the null mutation of HSV-1 UL34 caused specific dispersion throughout the cytoplasm of CD98hc and the HSV-1 de-envelopment regulators, glycoproteins B and H (gB and gH); (ii) as observed with CD98hc, gB, and gH, wild-type HSV-1 infection caused redistribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers calnexin and ERp57 around the NM, whereas the UL34-null mutation caused cytoplasmic dispersion of these markers; (iii) the ER markers colocalized efficiently with CD98hc, gB, and gH in the presence and absence of UL34 in HSV-1-infected cells; (iv) at the ultrastructural level, wild-type HSV-1 infection caused ER compression around the NM, whereas the UL34-null mutation caused cytoplasmic dispersion of the ER; and (v) the UL34-null mutation significantly decreased the colocalization efficiency of lamin protein markers of the NM with CD98hc and gB. Collectively, these results indicate that HSV-1 infection causes redistribution of the ER around the NM, with resulting accumulation of ER-associated CD98hc, gB, and gH around the NM and that UL34 is required for ER redistribution, as well as for efficient recruitment to the NM of the ER-associated de-envelopment factors. Our study suggests that HSV-1 induces remodeling of the global ER architecture for recruitment of regulators mediating viral nuclear egress to the NM.
   IMPORTANCE The ER is an important cellular organelle that exists as a complex network extending throughout the cytoplasm. Although viruses often remodel the ER to facilitate viral replication, information on the effects of herpesvirus infections on ER morphological integrity is limited. Here, we showed that HSV-1 infection led to compression of the global ER architecture around the NM, resulting in accumulation of ER-associated regulators associated with nuclear egress of HSV-1 nucleocapsids. We also identified HSV-1 UL34 as a viral factor that mediated ER remodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UL34 was required for efficient targeting of these regulators to the NM. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a herpesvirus remodels ER global architecture. Our study also provides insight into the mechanism by which the regulators for HSV-1 nuclear egress are recruited to the NM, where this viral event occurs.

TI Filamentous Structures Induced by a Phytoreovirus Mediate Viral Release

AB Numerous viral pathogens are persistently transmitted by insect vectors and cause agricultural or health problems. These viruses circulate in the vector body, enter the salivary gland, and then are released into the apical plasmalemma-lined cavities, where saliva is stored. The cavity plasmalemma of vector salivary glands thus represents the last membrane barrier for viral transmission. Here, we report a novel mechanism used by a persistent virus to overcome this essential barrier. We observed that the infection by rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV), a species of the genus Phytoreovirus in the family Reoviridae, induced the formation of virus-associated filaments constructed by viral nonstructural protein Pns11 within the salivary glands of its leafhopper vector, Recilia dorsalis. Such filaments attached to actin-based apical plasmalemma and induced an exocytosis-like process for viral release into vector salivary gland cavities, through a direct interaction of Pns11 of RGDV and actin of R. dorsalis. Failure of virus-induced filaments assembly by RNA interference with synthesized double-stranded RNA targeting the Pns11 gene inhibited the dissemination of RGDV into salivary cavities, preventing viral transmission by R. dorsalis. For the first time, we show that a virus can exploit virus-induced inclusion as a vehicle to pass through the apical plasmalemma into vector salivary gland cavities, thus overcoming the last membrane barrier for viral transmission by insect vectors.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding how persistent viruses overcome multiple tissue and membrane barriers within the insect vectors until final transmission is the key for viral disease control. The apical plasmalemma of the cavities where saliva is stored in the salivary glands is the last barrier for viral transmission by insect vectors; however, the mechanism is still poorly understood. Here we show that a virus has evolved to exploit virus-induced filaments to perform an exocytosis-like process that enables viral passage through the apical plasmalemma into salivary cavities. This mechanism could be extensively exploited by other persistent viruses to overcome salivary gland release barriers in insect vectors, opening new perspectives for viral control.

AB Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is acquired by the oral route in children, and primary infection is associated with abundant mucosal replication, as well as the establishment of latency in myeloid cells that results in lifelong infection. The efficiency of primary CMV infection in humans following oral exposure, however, is unknown. We consistently detected self-limited, low-level oral CMV shedding events, which we termed transient CMV infections, in a prospective birth cohort of 30 highly exposed CMV-uninfected infants. We estimated the likelihood of transient oral CMV infections by comparing their observed frequency to that of established primary infections, characterized by persistent high-level shedding, viremia, and seroconversion. We developed mathematical models of viral dynamics upon initial oral CMV infection and validated them using clinical shedding data. Transient infections comprised 76 to 88% of oral CMV shedding events. For this high percentage of transient infections to occur, we identified two mathematical prerequisites: a very small number of initially infected oral cells (1 to 4) and low viral infectivity (< 1.5 new cells infected/cell). These observations indicate that oral CMV infection in infants typically begins with a single virus that spreads inefficiently to neighboring cells. Thus, although the incidence of CMV infection is high during infancy, our data provide a mechanistic framework to explain why multiple CMV exposures are typically required before infection is successfully established. These findings imply that a sufficiently primed immune response could prevent CMV from establishing latent infection in humans and support the achievability of a prophylactic CMV vaccine.
   IMPORTANCE CMV infects the majority of the world's population and is a major cause of birth defects. Developing a vaccine to prevent CMV infection would be extremely valuable but would be facilitated by a better understanding of how natural human CMV infection is acquired. We studied CMV acquisition in infants and found that infections are usually brief and self-limited and are successfully established relatively rarely. Thus, although most people eventually acquire CMV infection, it usually requires numerous exposures. Our analyses indicate that this is because the virus is surprisingly inefficient, barely replicating well enough to spread to neighboring cells in the mouth. Greater knowledge of why CMV infection usually fails may provide insight into how to prevent it from succeeding.

TI Reverse Transcription Mechanically Initiates HIV-1 Capsid Disassembly

AB The HIV-1 core consists of the viral genomic RNA and several viral proteins encased within a conical capsid. After cell entry, the core disassembles in a process termed uncoating. Although HIV-1 uncoating has been linked to reverse transcription of the viral genome in target cells, the mechanism by which uncoating is initiated is unknown. Using time-lapse atomic force microscopy, we analyzed the morphology and physical properties of isolated HIV-1 cores during the course of reverse transcription in vitro. We found that, during an early stage of reverse transcription the pressure inside the capsid increases, reaching a maximum after 7 h. Highre-solution mechanical mapping reveals the formation of a stiff coiled filamentous structure underneath the capsid surface. Subsequently, this coiled structure disappears, the stiffness of the capsid drops precipitously to a value below that of a prereverse transcription core, and the capsid undergoes partial or complete rupture near the narrow end of the conical structure. We propose that the transcription of the relatively flexible single-stranded RNA into a more rigid filamentous structure elevates the pressure within the core, which triggers the initiation of capsid disassembly.
   IMPORTANCE For successful infection, the HIV-1 genome, which is in the form of a single-stranded RNA enclosed inside a capsid shell, must be reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA and released from the capsid (in a process known as uncoating) before it can be integrated into the target cell genome. The mechanism that triggers uncoating is a pivotal question of long standing. By using atomic force microscopy, we found that during reverse transcription the pressure inside the capsid increases until the internal stress exceeds the strength of the capsid structure and the capsid breaks open. The application of AFM technologies to study purified HIV-1 cores represents a new experimental platform for elucidating additional aspects of capsid disassembly and HIV-1 uncoating.

AB Soluble, recombinant native-like envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers of various human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypes are being developed for structural studies and as vaccine candidates aimed at the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The prototypic design is designated SOSIP. 664, but many HIV-1 env genes do not yield fully native-like trimers efficiently. One such env gene is CZA97.012 from a neutralization-resistant (tier 2) clade C virus. As appropriately purified, native-like CZA97.012 SOSIP. 664 trimers induce autologous neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) efficiently in immunized rabbits, we sought to improve the efficiency with which they can be produced and to better understand the limitations to the original design. By using structure and antigenicity-guided mutagenesis strategies focused on the V2 and V3 regions and the gp120-gp41 interface, we developed the CZA97 SOSIP.v4.2-M6. IT construct. Fully native-like, stable trimers that display multiple bNAb epitopes could be expressed from this construct in a stable CHO cell line and purified at an acceptable yield using either a PGT145 or a 2G12 bNAb affinity column. We also show that similar mutagenesis strategies can be used to improve the yields and properties of SOSIP. 664 trimers of the DU422, 426c, and 92UG037 genotypes.
   IMPORTANCE Recombinant trimeric proteins based on HIV-1 env genes are being developed for future vaccine trials in humans. A feature of these proteins is their mimicry of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) structure on virus particles that is targeted by neutralizing antibodies, i.e., antibodies that prevent cells from becoming infected. The vaccine concept under exploration is that recombinant trimers may be able to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies when delivered as immunogens. Because HIV-1 is extremely variable, a practical vaccine may need to incorporate Env trimers derived from multiple different virus sequences. Accordingly, we need to understand how to make recombinant trimers from many different env genes. Here, we show how to produce trimers from a clade C virus, CZA97.012, by using an array of protein engineering techniques to improve a prototypic construct. We also show that the methods may have wider utility for other env genes, thereby further guiding immunogen design.

AB Influenza B virus (IBV) is considered a major human pathogen, responsible for seasonal epidemics of acute respiratory illness. Two antigenically distinct IBV hemagglutinin (HA) lineages cocirculate worldwide with little cross-reactivity. Live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines have been shown to provide better cross-protective immune responses than inactivated vaccines by eliciting local mucosal immunity and systemic B cell- and T cell- mediated memory responses. We have shown previously that incorporation of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations into the PB1 and PB2 subunits along with a modified HA epitope tag in the C terminus of PB1 resulted in influenza A viruses (IAV) that are safe and effective as modified live attenuated (att) virus vaccines (IAV att). We explored whether analogous mutations in the IBV polymerase subunits would result in a stable virus with an att phenotype. The PB1 subunit of the influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain was used to incorporate ts mutations and a C-terminal HA tag. Such modifications resulted in a B/Bris att strain with ts characteristics in vitro and an att phenotype in vivo. Vaccination studies in mice showed that a single dose of the B/Bris att candidate stimulated sterilizing immunity against lethal homologous challenge and complete protection against heterologous challenge. These studies show the potential of an alternative LAIV platform for the development of IBV vaccines.
   IMPORTANCE A number of issues with regard to the effectiveness of the LAIV vaccine licensed in the United States (FluMist) have arisen over the past three seasons (2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016). While the reasons for the limited robustness of the vaccine-elicited immune response remain controversial, this problem highlights the critical importance of continued investment in LAIV development and creates an opportunity to improve current strategies so as to develop more efficacious vaccines. Our laboratory has developed an alternative strategy, the incorporation of 2 amino acid mutations and a modified HA tag at the C terminus of PB1, which is sufficient to attenuate the IBV. As a LAIV, this novel vaccine provides complete protection against IBV strains. The availability of attenuated IAV and IBV backbones based on contemporary strains offers alternative platforms for the development of LAIVs that may overcome current limitations.

AB The high mutation rates of the influenza virus genome facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs against influenza virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective. Therefore, we identified host cell determinants dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication, with the goal of preventing viral escape and finding effective antivirals. To identify these host factors, we screened 2,732 human genes using RNA interference and focused on one of the identified host factors, the double plant homeodomain fingers 2 (DPF2/REQ) gene, for this study. We found that knockdown of DPF2 in cells infected with influenza virus resulted in decreased expression of viral proteins and RNA. Furthermore, production of progeny virus was reduced by two logs in the multiple-cycle growth kinetics assay. We also found that DPF2 was involved in the replication of seasonal influenza A and B viruses. Because DPF2 plays a crucial role in the noncanonical NF-kappa B pathway, which negatively regulates type I interferon (IFN) induction, we examined the relationship between DPF2 and IFN responses during viral infection. The results showed that knockdown of DPF2 resulted in increased expression of IFN-beta and induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in infected cells. In addition, high levels of several cytokines/chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8], IP-10, and IL-6) and antiviral proteins (MxA and ISG56) were produced by DPF2 knockdown cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel host factor, DPF2, that is required for influenza virus to evade the host immune response and that may serve as a potential antiviral target.
   IMPORTANCE Influenza virus is responsible for seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics and is an ongoing threat to public health worldwide. Influenza virus relies heavily on cellular factors to complete its life cycle. Here we identified a novel host factor, DPF2, which is involved in influenza virus infection. Our results showed that DPF2 plays a crucial role in the replication and propagation of influenza virus. DPF2 functions in the noncanonical NF-kappa B pathway, which negatively regulates type I IFN induction. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the IFN response and DPF2 in influenza virus infection. Upon influenza virus infection, DPF2 dysregulated IFN-beta induction and expression of cytokines/chemokines and antiviral proteins. This study provides evidence that influenza virus utilizes DPF2 to escape host innate immunity.

AB Using atomic force microscopy imaging and nanoindentation measurements, we investigated the effect of the minor capsid proteins pUL17 and pUL25 on the structural stability of icosahedral herpes simplex virus capsids. pUL17 and pUL25, which form the capsid vertex-specific component (CVSC), particularly contributed to capsid resilience along the 5-fold and 2-fold but not along the 3-fold icosahedral axes. Our detailed analyses, including quantitative mass spectrometry of the protein composition of the capsids, revealed that both pUL17 and pUL25 are required to stabilize the capsid shells at the vertices. This indicates that herpesviruses withstand the internal pressure that is generated during DNA genome packaging by locally reinforcing the mechanical sturdiness of the vertices, the most stressed part of the capsids.
   IMPORTANCE In this study, the structural, material properties of herpes simplex virus 1 were investigated. The capsid of herpes simplex virus is built up of a variety of proteins, and we scrutinized the influence of two of these proteins on the stability of the capsid. For this, we used a scanning force microscope that makes detailed, topographic images of the particles and that is able to perform mechanical deformation measurements. Using this approach, we revealed that both studied proteins play an essential role in viral stability. These new insights support us in forming a complete view on viral structure and furthermore could possibly help not only to develop specific antivirals but also to build protein shells with improved stability for drug delivery purposes.

TI An Immortalized Human Dorsal Root Ganglion Cell Line Provides a Novel
   Context To Study Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Latency and Reactivation

AB A defining characteristic of alphaherpesviruses is the establishment of lifelong latency in host sensory ganglia with occasional reactivation causing recurrent lytic infections. As an alternative to rodent models, we explored the use of an immortalized cell line derived from human dorsal root ganglia. HD10.6 cells proliferate by virtue of a transduced tetracycline-regulated v-myc oncogene. In the presence of doxycycline, HD10.6 cells mature to exhibit neuronal morphology and express sensory neuron-associated markers such as neurotrophin receptors TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and RET and the sensory neurofilament peripherin. Infection of mature HD10.6 neurons by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) results in a delayed but productive infection. However, infection at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the presence of acyclovir results in a quiescent infection resembling latency in which viral genomes are retained in a low number of neurons, viral gene expression is minimal, and infectious virus is not released. At least some of the quiescent viral genomes retain the capacity to reactivate, resulting in viral DNA replication and release of infectious virus. Reactivation can be induced by depletion of nerve growth factor; other commonly used reactivation stimuli have no significant effect.
   IMPORTANCE Infections by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) cause painful cold sores or genital lesions in many people; less often, they affect the eye or even the brain. After the initial infection, the virus remains inactive or latent in nerve cells that sense the region where that infection occurred. To learn how virus maintains and reactivates from latency, studies are done in neurons taken from rodents or in whole animals to preserve the full context of infection. However, some cellular mechanisms involved in HSV infection in rodents are different from those in humans. We describe the use of a human cell line that has the properties of a sensory neuron. HSV infection in these cultured cells shows the properties expected for a latent infection, including reactivation to produce newly infectious virus. Thus, we now have a cell culture model for latency that is derived from the normal host for this virus.

   SURVEILLANCE
AB Influenza A H15 viruses are members of a subgroup (H7-H10-H15) of group 2 hemagglutinin IHA) subtypes that include H7N9 and H10N8 viruses that were isolated from humans during 2013. The isolation of avian H15 viruses is, however, quite rare and, until recently, geographically restricted to wild shorebirds and waterfowl in Australia. The HAs of H15 viruses contain an insertion in the 150-loop (loop beginning at position 150) of the receptor-binding site common to this subgroup and a unique insertion in the 260-loop compared to any other subtype. Here, we show that the H15 HA has a high preference for avian receptor analogs by glycan array analyses. The H15 HA crystal structure reveals that it is structurally closest to H7N9 HA, but the head domain of the H15 trimer is wider than all other HAs due to a tilt and opening of the HA1 subunits of the head domain. The extended 150-loop of the H15 HA retains the conserved conformation as in H7 and H10 HAs. Furthermore, the elongated 260-loop increases the exposed HA surface and can contribute to antigenic variation in H15 HAs. Since avian-origin H15 HA viruses have been shown to cause enhanced disease in mammalian models, further characterization and immune surveillance of H15 viruses are warranted.
   IMPORTANCE In the last 2 decades, an apparent increase has been reported for cases of human infection by emerging avian influenza A virus subtypes, including H7N9 and H10N8 viruses isolated during 2013. H15 is the other member of the subgroup of influenza A virus group 2 hemagglutinins IHAs) that also include H7 and H10. H15 viruses have been restricted to Australia, but recent isolation of H15 viruses in western Siberia suggests that they could be spread more globally via the avian flyways that converge and emanate from this region. Here we report on characterization of the three-dimensional structure and receptor specificity of the H15 hemagglutinin, revealing distinct features and specificities that can aid in global surveillance of such viruses for potential spread and emerging threat to the human population.

TI Overactive Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling Leads to Increased

AB Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus that causes morbidity and mortality in humans. After infection with SARS-CoV, the acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function. A dysregulation in this wound healing process leads to fibrosis. Many survivors of SARS-CoV infection develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), with higher prevalence in older patients. Using mouse models of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, we have identified that the wound repair pathway, controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is critical to recovery from SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage. In mice with constitutively active EGFR [EGFR(DSK5) mice], we find that SARS-CoV infection causes enhanced lung disease. Importantly, we show that during infection, the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) are upregulated, and exogenous addition of these ligands during infection leads to enhanced lung disease and altered wound healing dynamics. Our data demonstrate a key role of EGFR in the host response to SARS-CoV and how it may be implicated in lung disease induced by other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses.
   IMPORTANCE PF has many causative triggers, including severe respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV. Currently there are no treatments to prevent the onset or limit the progression of PF, and the molecular pathways underlying the development of PF are not well understood. In this study, we identified a role for the balanced control of EGFR signaling as a key factor in progression to PF. These data demonstrate that therapeutic treatment modulating EGFR activation could protect against PF development caused by severe respiratory virus infection.

AB The NS2A protein of dengue virus (DENV) has eight predicted transmembrane segments (pTMS1 to -8) and participates in RNA replication, virion assembly, and host antiviral response. However, the roles of specific amino acid residues within the pTMS regions of NS2A during the viral life cycle are not clear. Here, we explore the function of DENV NS2A by introducing a series of alanine substitutions into the N-terminal half (pTMS1 to -4) of the protein in the context of a DENV infectious clone or subgenomic replicon. Six NS2A mutants (NM5, -7, -9, and -17 to -19) around pTMS1 and -2 displayed a novel phenotype showing a > 1,000-fold reduction in virus yield, an absence of plaque formation despite wild-type-like replicon activity, and infectious-virus-like particle yields. HEK-293 cells infected with the six NS2A mutant viruses failed to cause a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by Mito-Capture staining, cell proliferation, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. Sequencing analyses of pseudorevertant viruses derived from lethal-mutant viruses revealed two consensus reversion mutations, leucine to phenylalanine at codon 181 (L181F) within pTMS7 of NS2A and isoleucine to threonine at codon 114 (I114T) within NS2B. The introduction of an NS2A-L181F mutation into the lethal (NM15, -16, -25, and -33) and CPE-defective (NM7, -9, and -19) mutants substantially rescued virus infectivity and virus-induced CPE, respectively, whereas the NS2B-L114T mutation rescued the NM16, -25, and -33 mutants. In conclusion, the results revealed the essential roles of the N-terminal half of NS2A in RNA replication and virus-induced CPE. Intramolecular interactions between pTMSs of NS2A and intermolecular interactions between the NS2A and NS2B proteins were also implicated.
   IMPORTANCE The characterization of the N-terminal (current study) and C-terminal halves of DENV NS2A is the most comprehensive mutagenesis study to date to investigate the function of NS2A during the flaviviral life cycle. A novel region responsible for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) within pTMS1 and -2 of DENV NS2A was identified. Revertant genetics studies implied unexpected relationships between various pTMSs of DENV NS2A and NS2B. These results provide comprehensive information regarding the functions of DENV NS2A and the specific amino acids and transmembrane segments responsible for these functions. The positions and properties of the rescuing mutations were also revealed, providing important clues regarding the manner in which intramolecular or intermolecular interactions between the pTMSs of NS2A and NS2B regulate virus replication, assembly/secretion, and virus-induced CPE. These results expand the understanding of flavivirus replication. The knowledge may also facilitate studies of pathogenesis and novel vaccine and antiflaviviral drug development.
